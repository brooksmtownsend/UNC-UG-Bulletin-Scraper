still eligible to participate in the program. They will participate in the
same academic courses, leadership laboratory, and physical training as
traditional students. All nontraditional cadets will be required to complete
AERO 101, AERO 102, AERO 201, and AERO 202 prior to attending field
training and must be able to complete at least three semesters of college
as a full-time student following field training.
Interested Students
First- and second-year students seeking to learn more about the Air
Force and ROTC can take AERO 101, AERO 102, AERO 201, or AERO 202
with no obligation. These courses provide a solid introduction to Air
Force operations and culture, providing students with the necessary
information to make an informed decision about whether the Air Force
interests them.

Advising

All majors and minors have a primary academic advisor in Steele
Building. At a minimum, students who join the AFROTC program are
required to meet with their advisor every fall term to develop and update
their academic plan. The department’s education officer and academic
instructors help oversee this process. For information on Air Force officer
careers, please visit www.afrotc.com (http://www.afrotc.com).

Special Opportunities in Aerospace
Studies
Scholarships and Financial Assistance
Two- to four-year scholarships are available to students based on merit or
specialized major (e.g., foreign language or nursing). In most cases, these
scholarships cover tuition and fees, and provide a tax-free allowance
($250 to $400 each month) and a textbook allowance ($600) each
semester.
Foreign Language/Study Abroad Stipend and
Opportunities
All contract and scholarship cadets are eligible to earn up to $3,000 per
academic year for studying a foreign language or participating in a study
abroad program.

Air Force ROTC cadets are uniquely eligible to participate in Department
of Defense language grant programs through major universities,
often involving study abroad. See www.rotcprojectgo.org (http://
www.rotcprojectgo.org) or contact the unit admissions officer for more
information.
Extracurricular Activities
The AFROTC experience is much more than classroom studies. Cadets
participate in a range of activities. These include social functions such
as a formal dinner, fundraising events, color guard at home football
and basketball games, volunteer work in the community, and field trips
to military bases. Recent cadet activities are highlighted on a public
Facebook page (http://www.facebook.com/UNC.AFROTC.DET590).

Arnold Air Society (AAS) is a national service organization dedicated to
furthering the traditions, purposes, and concepts of the United States Air
Force as a military organization and a professional calling. The local AAS
chapter is active nationwide, and AFROTC cadets attend the regional and
national conventions each year.

Introduction

The curriculum of the Department of African, African American, and
Diaspora Studies emphasizes the histories, cultures, cultural linkages,
and contemporary sociopolitical and economic realities of Africa and the
African diasporas in the context of a globalizing world. Included on our
faculty are award-winning teachers and recognized scholars whose work
in and out of the classroom covers all major regions of Africa, the United
States, and increasingly other parts of the Atlantic African Diaspora,
including the Caribbean and Latin America. We approach these areas of
study from multiple perspectives and disciplines, and the department’s
faculty members are trained in the fields of anthropology, film, history,
international development studies, law, linguistics, literature, music, and
political science.

Advising

We encourage students to talk with the director of undergraduate studies
when they declare the major in African, African American, and Diaspora
studies. The director of undergraduate studies is also available to
students who are interested in the department’s offerings at other times
in their academic careers.

Graduate School and Career Opportunities

The skills and perspectives of African, African American, and Diaspora
studies provide an excellent background for students considering
careers in international development, education, business, government,
or diplomacy. Students go on to a variety of managerial, teaching,
and research positions. Other careers for which the major is excellent
preparation include law, communication, social work, community
development, and public administration.

BERNARD HERMAN, Chair

Introduction

The Department of American Studies is one of the longest-standing
interdisciplinary programs at UNC–Chapel Hill, with roots in the study
of folklore and the American South going back to the 1920s. A formal
program in American studies was established in 1968, and exciting
additions in American Indian and indigenous studies, Southern studies,
and global American studies have been added in the past two decades.
The Department of American Studies has a tradition of vigorous teaching
and an innovative curriculum that offers stimulating opportunities to
study the United States and the diversity and influence of its peoples,
institutions, texts, performances, and places. In addition, each of our
areas of major concentration incorporates global and comparative
perspectives. The department’s commitment to interdisciplinary
approaches empowers students to value the nation’s complexity by
engaging with a variety of historical, literary, artistic, political, social,
cultural, legal, racial, ethnic, and ethnographic perspectives within and
beyond the United States. American studies majors graduate with a
comprehension of the dynamics of American culture that prepares them
to make a responsible and critical difference in the variety of professions
they choose to pursue.

The American studies major offers five areas of concentration, each with
its own distinct degree requirements.

Advising

All majors and minors have a primary academic advisor in Steele
Building. Students are strongly encouraged to meet regularly with
their advisor and review their Tar Heel Tracker each semester. The
department’s director of undergraduate studies works with current and
prospective majors and minors by appointment. Further information on
courses, opportunities, and honors theses may be obtained from the
department’s Web site.

Graduate School and Career Opportunities

American studies is an excellent liberal arts major for students interested
in graduate and professional school study. The major prepares students
for graduate work in fields such as American history and literature.
After receiving the baccalaureate degree, American studies majors
consistently have been accepted in law and business schools, which
are interested in students with a broad, interdisciplinary undergraduate
background. American studies provides a solid basis for a variety of
career choices, including public service, business, teaching, museum
curation, and journalism. The folklore concentration and minor are a
productive component of study for those preparing for graduate school
in anthropology, communication, journalism, music, and folklore itself,

as well as for those planning careers in museum curation, public arts
presentation, and music production.

H Honors version available. An honors course fulfills the same

requirements as the nonhonors version of that course. Enrollment
and GPA restrictions may apply.

AMST 396, FOLK 490, and FOLK 690 may fall under various categories,
depending on the focus of these courses in a given semester; the course
instructor and director of undergraduate studies will decide which
category they fulfill.

At the core of the undergraduate major concentration in American
studies are two required courses in interdisciplinary cultural analysis
(see above). Majors also choose at least two advanced seminars in the
department that focus readings and research on topics representative
of both the talents of its faculty members and emergent directions in
American studies scholarship. For the remainder of their requirements,
majors select a series of relevant electives offered by over a dozen
different University departments and curricula. These courses deepen
majors’ interdisciplinary awareness of American traditions, institutions,
literature, and arts as well as expose students to a diversity of American
experiences and perspectives. Students may petition the director of
undergraduate studies to have courses not listed approved to fulfill major
requirements; such courses will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis.

Special Opportunities in American Studies
Honors in American Studies
The American studies major offers a two-course honors program:
AMST 691H in the fall semester and AMST 692H in the spring semester.
Folklore also offers a two-course honors program: FOLK 691H in the fall
semester and FOLK 692H in the spring semester. Students must propose
their thesis and contract with a faculty advisor during the semester
prior to the beginning of their senior year. For each semester of honors
work, thesis students must submit a signed learning contract to the
Department of American Studies during the registration period. During
the two semesters devoted to honors work, students conduct individual
research and prepare an honors thesis under the supervision of a faculty
member. Students also will attend a weekly seminar at the discretion
of the advisor. Students must maintain a 3.3 cumulative grade point
average to be eligible. With the approval of the associate or the assistant
dean for honors, students with a slightly lower average who have a
reasonable expectation of meeting the requirement within one more
semester may embark upon the honors thesis, understanding that if they
do not attain the 3.3 standard they may continue the research project as
independent study but are not eligible to graduate with honors or highest
honors.
Experiential Education
The Department of American Studies offers a seminar on Service
Learning in America (AMST 398) and offers credits for approved
internship projects (AMST 493). Students have learned about American
studies by serving the community in museums, schools, social agencies,
and other cultural institutions.
Study Abroad
The Department of American Studies encourages students to consider
a semester or more of study abroad and has developed close relations
with several American studies programs in different countries. Studying
American experience in international contexts is an integral part of
understanding the place and influence of the United States in the
world. Student learning is enhanced by the perspectives gained by
examining how American subjects are taught in universities around
the globe as well as by encountering the international students who
enroll in American studies courses in Chapel Hill. Study abroad offers
students of folklore the opportunity to understand the rich vernacular
and traditional cultures of other parts of the world from both a local
and a comparative perspective. Students can receive American studies
major credit for selected study abroad programs and are encouraged
to make study abroad part of their academic plans. Study abroad
courses can count toward the international American studies major or
minor. Students interested in this experience should consult with the
director of undergraduate studies or with the Study Abroad Office about
international exchange programs sponsored by UNC–Chapel Hill.
Undergraduate Awards
The department awards Julia Preston Brumley Travel Scholarships to
help fund international travel and study abroad. The Peter C. Baxter
Memorial Prize is awarded annually to the outstanding senior majoring in
American studies.
Undergraduate Research
The Department offers credit for AMST 396 and FOLK 495. Majors
can develop a two-semester honors thesis project (AMST 691H and
AMST 692H or FOLK 691H and FOLK 692H) in consultation with an
advisor. Students have received summer undergraduate research

University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill            133

fellowships, earned research support and travel awards, and presented
their work at the Annual Celebration of Undergraduate Research each
spring.

The American Indian and indigenous studies concentration provides
a meaningful grounding in the histories, cultures, and contemporary
experiences of peoples indigenous to North America, as well as their
encounters with settler states. The curriculum increasingly provides
opportunities for students to gain a hemispheric perspective that
includes the histories, cultures, and contemporary experiences of the
indigenous peoples of the Americas. Students may petition the director
of undergraduate studies to have courses not listed approved to fulfill
major requirements; such courses will be evaluated on a case-by-case
basis.

Folklore also offers a two-course honors program: FOLK 691H in the fall
semester and FOLK 692H in the spring semester. Students must propose

their thesis and contract with a faculty advisor during the semester
prior to the beginning of their senior year. For each semester of honors
work, thesis students must submit a signed learning contract to the
Department of American Studies during the registration period. During
the two semesters devoted to honors work, students conduct individual
research and prepare an honors thesis under the supervision of a faculty
member. Students also will attend a weekly seminar at the discretion
of the advisor. Students must maintain a 3.3 cumulative grade point
average to be eligible. With the approval of the associate or the assistant
dean for honors, students with a slightly lower average who have a
reasonable expectation of meeting the requirement within one more
semester may embark upon the honors thesis, understanding that if they

The concentration in folklore emphasizes the study of creativity and
aesthetic expression in everyday life, focusing on those expressive
realms that communities infuse with cultural meaning and through
which they give voice to the issues and concerns they see as central
to their being. These realms are often deeply grounded in tradition; this
doesn’t mean, however, that they’re always or necessarily old. Just as
communities change their own sense of self in response to shifting
social, political, and economic realities, so too does the artistry they
create evolve. Folklore thus moves beyond the study of the old and time-
honored to explore emergent meanings and cultural forms. Trending
tweets, food trucks, slam poetry, and hip hop freestyling are just as
relevant to folklorists’ study as are string-band tunes, Cherokee quilts,
family recipes, and blues. The communities that our students study
are equally broad, ranging from Lumbee sheetrock workers and Latino
line cooks to urban homesteaders and Black Lives Matter activists. The
main way that we explore contemporary folklore, in turn, is ethnographic
fieldwork, the real-world study of people’s lives in everyday settings,
grounded in conversation and participatory engagement. Students may
petition the director of undergraduate studies to have courses not listed
approved to fulfill major requirements; such courses will be evaluated on
a case-by-case basis.

The major concentration in global American studies maps the reach
of American cultures across political and geographical boundaries
and through myriad exchanges and intersections. It encourages an
engagement with “the global” that extends from the local and regional to
the national and transnational, and back again. This major concentration
aims to situate the study of American culture in relation to both
the recent effects of globalization and in recognition of the always-
global character of “America.” Students may petition the director of
undergraduate studies to have courses not listed approved to fulfill major

ecology, environment, folklife, foodways, geography, history, journalism,
language, law, literature, material culture, myth and manners, music, oral
history, politics, public health, religion, values, and more. Students may

Special Opportunities in American Studies
Honors in American Studies
The American studies major offers a two-course honors program:
AMST 691H in the fall semester and AMST 692H in the spring semester.
Folklore also offers a two-course honors program: FOLK 691H in the fall
semester and FOLK 692H in the spring semester. Students must propose
their thesis and contract with a faculty advisor during the semester
prior to the beginning of their senior year. For each semester of honors
work, thesis students must submit a signed learning contract to the
Department of American Studies during the registration period. During
the two semesters devoted to honors work, students conduct individual

University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill            141

research and prepare an honors thesis under the supervision of a faculty
member. Students also will attend a weekly seminar at the discretion
of the advisor. Students must maintain a 3.3 cumulative grade point
average to be eligible. With the approval of the associate or the assistant
dean for honors, students with a slightly lower average who have a
reasonable expectation of meeting the requirement within one more
semester may embark upon the honors thesis, understanding that if they
do not attain the 3.3 standard they may continue the research project as
independent study but are not eligible to graduate with honors or highest
honors.
Experiential Education
The Department of American Studies offers a seminar on Service
Learning in America (AMST 398) and offers credits for approved
internship projects (AMST 493). Students have learned about American
studies by serving the community in museums, schools, social agencies,
and other cultural institutions.
Study Abroad
The Department of American Studies encourages students to consider
a semester or more of study abroad and has developed close relations
with several American studies programs in different countries. Studying
American experience in international contexts is an integral part of
understanding the place and influence of the United States in the
world. Student learning is enhanced by the perspectives gained by
examining how American subjects are taught in universities around
the globe as well as by encountering the international students who
enroll in American studies courses in Chapel Hill. Study abroad offers
students of folklore the opportunity to understand the rich vernacular
and traditional cultures of other parts of the world from both a local
and a comparative perspective. Students can receive American studies
major credit for selected study abroad programs and are encouraged
to make study abroad part of their academic plans. Study abroad
courses can count toward the international American studies major or
minor. Students interested in this experience should consult with the
director of undergraduate studies or with the Study Abroad Office about
international exchange programs sponsored by UNC–Chapel Hill.
Undergraduate Awards
The department awards Julia Preston Brumley Travel Scholarships to
help fund international travel and study abroad. The Peter C. Baxter
Memorial Prize is awarded annually to the outstanding senior majoring in
American studies.
Undergraduate Research
The Department offers credit for AMST 396 and FOLK 495. Majors
can develop a two-semester honors thesis project (AMST 691H and
AMST 692H or FOLK 691H and FOLK 692H) in consultation with an
advisor. Students have received summer undergraduate research
fellowships, earned research support and travel awards, and presented
their work at the Annual Celebration of Undergraduate Research each
spring.

Introduction

Anthropology is the integrative study of human beings at all times and in
all places. Anthropological expertise has special application for hidden
histories and the ancient past; the intersection of human biology and
ecology; and the way communities create and use meaning, values, and
history in everyday life. We support studies, research, and professional
applications in these areas with three programs of foundational training:
archaeology; human biology, ecology, and evolution; and sociocultural
anthropology.

Cutting across these specializations, the department supports
concentrations that integrate anthropology’s diverse expertise to address
contemporary world problems. Programming in these areas helps
students connect their anthropological studies to work and life beyond
the University. Current concentrations focus on health, medicine, and
humanity; heritage and unwritten histories; global engagement; race,
place and power; and food, environment, and sustainability.

Together, the Department of Anthropology’s programs and
concentrations offer the undergraduate student one of the best
introductions possible to our biological and cultural pasts and to our
contemporary world. Anthropology majors thus develop the written
and oral skills needed to live and work in a complex world marked
by an accelerated rate of environmental, social, and cultural change.
Anthropology majors acquire general knowledge and skills valued within
a large number of occupations and professions, including but not limited
to professional anthropology.

Advising

All majors and minors have a primary academic advisor in Steele
Building. Students are strongly encouraged to meet regularly with
their advisor and review their Tar Heel Tracker each semester.
The department’s director of undergraduate studies (see “Contact
Information” above) works with current and prospective majors and
minors by appointment. Students are encouraged to consult with the
director of undergraduate studies about course choices and field work
opportunities. Departmental academic advising is particularly important
for those majors who are considering going on to graduate school.
Further information on courses, undergraduate research opportunities,
and the honors program may be obtained from the department’s Web
site.

Graduate School and Career Opportunities

There are three basic career paths for B.A.-level anthropology majors:

• Anthropology majors have open to them all of the career options

of any student with a bachelor of arts degree in the liberal arts and
social sciences, with the added advantage that they surely are more

prepared than most in the growing international arena of business,
government, and nongovernmental organizations (NGOs). The
resources and professional staff of University Career Services and
the department’s director of undergraduate studies can provide
guidance.

• Anthropology majors can seek a career that puts their anthropology

degree directly into practice.

• Lastly, anthropology majors can continue with graduate education in
order to seek a career in education, either as a social studies teacher
in a school or a professor in a university. See Careers in Academic
Anthropology–Graduate School Route (http://anthropology.unc.edu/
undergraduate-program/career-tracks).

The theoretical perspectives requirement serves as the major’s core
course; it offers an integrative perspective on the theories and history
of anthropology and explores what it means to be an anthropologist.
Majors should fulfill this requirement in their junior year. If they
cannot do so, they should consult with the director of undergraduate
studies.

The department recommends that majors enroll in some field-oriented
coursework such as ANTH 393, ANTH 395, ANTH 451, ANTH 453, or in
study abroad coursework.

Special Opportunities in Anthropology
Honors in Anthropology
Writing an honors thesis is an excellent way to cap one’s major in
anthropology. The process offers students the chance to carry out
original research on a topic that they are passionate about. Our thesis
writers work closely with a faculty advisor and committee members to
develop their project. The department provides excellent support, offering
a specific seminar during the fall (ANTH 691H) and a corresponding
independent study (ANTH 692H), that together walk students through
the essential steps of research design and writing. For our students,
writing an honors thesis continues to prove a pivotal experience—at once
a capstone to their studies at Carolina and an achievement to carry with
them into their lives and careers beyond.

To pursue an honors thesis project, students must:

• Maintain a minimum grade point average of 3.3 from the spring

semester of the junior year through the entirety of the senior year

• Secure a faculty advisor who is an anthropologist at UNC-Chapel Hill.
• Successfully complete the ANTH 691H and ANTH 692H sequence
• Receive approval from UNC’s Office for Human Research Ethics prior

to the start of research, for all projects involving human subjects

The process for approval requires several steps:

• Students considering an honor thesis should first contact the director

of undergraduate studies or the honors thesis seminar instructor,
during their junior year (or earlier).

• Eligible students next should secure an advisor prior to enrolling in
ANTH 691H for the fall semester of their senior year. Typically, the
advisor is a professor that they have worked with in a class or faculty
member with shared interests.

• In the fall students develop their research design and begin to write

their thesis (ANTH 691H).

• In the spring, students complete an independent study with their

advisor, focusing on writing the thesis (ANTH 692H). Students also
form their committee, by adding two additional faculty members.

• To complete the process, students defend (i.e., present and discuss)

their thesis to their committee. 

Internships, Field Work, and Independent Study
Students who wish to explore an anthropological concern outside the
conventional classroom setting, or who desire advanced or specialized

ANTH 393 provides anthropology students the opportunity to engage in
internships or other field experiences within or beyond the University that
have a significant anthropological learning component. Variable credit
may be obtained for this course. ANTH 393 is a controlled enrollment
course; it requires the permission in advance of the faculty member
sponsoring the internship, of a responsible official of the agency in which
the internship is carried, and of the director of undergraduate studies. It is
essential that students make arrangements and secure permissions prior
to the semester of the internship.

ANTH 396 provides anthropology students the opportunity to engage
in independent study, and ANTH 395, the opportunity to engage in field
research, in both cases under the mentoring of a specific faculty member.
Variable credit may be obtained for these courses, although three units
are usually expected. ANTH 396 and ANTH 395 require the permission of
the faculty member under whom the student wishes to conduct research
prior to the semester in which ANTH 396 or ANTH 395 is taken. Both are
controlled enrollment courses. In general, these courses should be taken
only by students with some prior coursework in anthropology or a related
social science.

ANTH 451 and ANTH 453 are six-unit field school courses in which the
student gains hands-on experience in research and study in the field
under the direction of a faculty member.

Anthropology majors are limited to having no more than six credit
hours of field-oriented coursework (ANTH 393, ANTH 395, ANTH 451, or
ANTH 453) count toward meeting the major requirement, although they
are not restricted from enrolling in more than six credit hours of these
courses combined.
Study Abroad
Anthropology majors are encouraged to enroll in a study abroad
program. These programs can offer direct experience of another culture
and intensive language training, as well as excellent coursework in
anthropology. By consulting with their departmental advisors as well
as with the University’s Study Abroad Office, students can assess the
relevance of available programs to their interests and arrange to transfer
credit hours to count toward their undergraduate degree and, where
appropriate, the anthropology major. Study abroad programs are often
affordable even to students who require financial aid. Information about
student loans and scholarships for the purpose of studying abroad can
be obtained from the Study Abroad Office.
Undergraduate Awards
The Honigmann Undergraduate Honors Thesis Award is given each year
to the student who completed the best undergraduate honors project.

Introduction

The undergraduate major in archaeology focuses on the systematic
study of the human past through its material remains by means of the
excavation, recovery, and interpretation of artifacts and other associated
evidence. Historical, environmental, and comparative components enable
the examination of different culture systems through time and space,
as well as the reconstruction of past lifeways and the interpretation of
ancient social, political, and economic systems. The geographic scope of
the program includes the Americas, Europe and the Mediterranean, Egypt,
and the Near East. The educational goal of the program is to provide
the student with a component of a liberal arts education that draws
on both the social sciences and the humanities. It also will effectively
prepare students for graduate study in anthropological archaeology,
Mediterranean archaeology, museology, and historical preservation, or
careers in contract archaeology and cultural resource management.
Students interested in applying to graduate programs in Mediterranean
or Near Eastern archaeology may need ancient language classes not
required for the major. Students should consult a faculty advisor in
archaeology if they have questions.

Advising

All majors and minors have a primary academic advisor in Steele
Building. Students are strongly encouraged to meet regularly with
their advisor and review their Tar Heel Tracker each semester.
The curriculum’s director of undergraduate studies (see “Contact
Information” above) works with current and prospective majors and
minors by appointment. Students are encouraged to consult with the
director of undergraduate studies about course choices and field work
opportunities. Curriculum academic advising is particularly important for
those majors who are considering going on to graduate school. Further
information on courses, undergraduate research opportunities, and the
honors program may be obtained from the curriculum’s Web site (http://
archaeology.unc.edu).

Graduate School and Career Opportunities

The undergraduate curriculum in archaeology prepares majors for
specialized graduate study in archaeology and cognate fields. The
specific area of graduate study will depend on the fields of concentration
of major, minor, and supporting coursework. Graduating majors (and
double majors and minors) may pursue degree programs and careers
in fields such as anthropology, Latin American studies, classical and
medieval archaeology, Egyptology and ancient Near Eastern archaeology,
art history, ancient history, and linguistics. Provided with a well-rounded
undergraduate degree in the liberal arts, graduating students may pursue

University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill            169

professional and graduate programs in diverse fields of the humanities
and social sciences, utilizing their skills in various professions such as
field archaeology (professional or contract archaeology), museology,
conservation and historical preservation, cultural resource and heritage
management, and teaching. Career resources as well as a list of former
graduates and their careers are available on the curriculum’s Web site

requirements as the nonhonors version of that course. Enrollment
and GPA restrictions may apply.

Subject to the approval of the advisor for the major, students may count
graduate seminars towards fulfillment of their comparative perspectives,
long-term history, and topics in archaeology or electives requirements.
Also subject to the approval of the archaeology major advisor, field
schools sponsored by Study Abroad or other universities may be used to
fulfill the archaeological practice field experience requirement.

Special Opportunities in Archaeology
Honors in Archaeology
Students with a grade point average of 3.3 or higher are eligible to pursue
a degree with honors. A student who wishes to take this track should
identify and contact a faculty thesis advisor before the end of the junior
year. During the senior year the student enrolls in a two-semester course
sequence, ARCH 691H and ARCH 692H, which provides the opportunity
to carry out an independent research project and write a thesis under
the direction of the faculty advisor. Prior to registering for the honors
courses, the student and faculty mentor must fill out a contract and
have it signed by the curriculum’s director of undergraduate studies.
The thesis is evaluated by a committee consisting of the advisor and
two readers. The advisor and at least one reader must be members of
the Curriculum in Archaeology’s faculty. A student who successfully
completes the thesis may be awarded honors or highest honors by the
committee. Highest honors is awarded only in cases where the thesis is
judged to be exceptional in comparison to other such works.
Research Laboratories of Archaeology
Founded in 1939, the Research Laboratories of Archaeology (RLA) was
the first center for the study of North Carolina archaeology. Serving the
interests of students, scholars, and the general public, it is currently
one of the leading institutes for archaeological teaching and research in
the South. Located within the College of Arts and Sciences, it provides
support and research opportunities for UNC–Chapel Hill students

University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill            173

working not only in North Carolina but also throughout the Americas and
overseas.
Duke–UNC Consortium for Classical and Mediterranean
Archaeology (CCMA)
The Duke–UNC Consortium for Classical and Mediterranean Archaeology
represents a collaboration between the institutions in order to enhance
archaeology curricula and concentrations in the respective departments
and programs in archaeology. The consortium fosters an interdisciplinary
dialogue on methods, theory, and practice in classical archaeology and
material culture, providing students access to coursework, seminars,
excavations, and other research opportunities; academic advising; and
avenues for curricular and extracurricular interaction.
Experiential Education
The development of skills and perspectives beyond the classroom is
considered central to the curriculum in archaeology. Hands-on training
in field archeology provides students with the basic tools not only
necessary for graduate training and advanced research in archaeology,
but also for careers in cultural resource and heritage management
through government agencies, contract firms, and museums. Developing
an understanding of context and physical environment in archaeology
requires field and laboratory experiences that are impossible to teach
effectively in the classroom. Excavation and laboratory experiences allow
students to participate directly in faculty research and to learn firsthand
important aspects of the research process. Two or more field schools in
archaeology are generally offered during summer sessions through the
Study Abroad Office by faculty from the departments of anthropology,
classics, religious studies, and history. In addition, many faculty research
associates offer laboratory experiences through independent study
projects and internships. These field work and laboratory experiences are
designed to enhance the classroom training, allowing students to work
as assistants to field archaeologists and specialists—such as surveyors,
archaeological architects, palaeoethnobotanists, zooarchaeologists,
biological anthropologists, and geomorphologists—learning firsthand
various aspects of data recovery, processing, and interpretation
associated with archaeological field projects.

Introduction

As a department, we are committed to working closely with our students
and to guiding them in developing an individual voice. From a strong
central core in the traditional practices of making and interpreting art,
the faculty and students at UNC–Chapel Hill move out in innovative and
personal directions. We cultivate exchange between studio art and art
history and offer maximum flexibility within our individual programs.

The art history curriculum is designed to help students acquire an
individual perspective on their own values and beliefs and on their places
in a society increasingly shaped by visual communication. Majors and
minors in art history become acquainted with the historical significance,
cultural diversity, and intellectual richness of human artistic traditions,
enabling students to investigate the complex roles played by the arts in a
variety of social contexts.

The studio art program encourages experimentation, crossing
boundaries, and hybrid processes as well as engaging the history and
traditions of art. Through directed practice and creative research, faculty
work closely with students to stimulate aesthetic and intellectual inquiry,
impart portable skills, and motivate self-exploration to help students
create outstanding works of art.

Students may choose from a range of studio coursework designed to
develop both skills and a personal creative vision. Students develop two
critical skills: the means of self-expression and techniques for creative
thinking. While the undergraduate program focuses on the fine arts, the
course of study nonetheless offers a sound foundation for students to
move into art education, design fields, and other art-related careers as
well as preparation for further study or careers in the fine arts.

Credit by Examination

Students who pass the Advanced Placement (AP) examination in art
history and earn a score of 4 or 5 will receive credit for ARTH 152.

Students who fulfill the studio art portfolio requirements for the
Advanced Placement (AP) examination and earn a score of 4 or 5 will
receive placement only (PL) for ARTS 102, ARTS 103, or ARTS 104.

Students who score a 3 can petition to waive relevant prerequisites via
portfolio review, although no course credit will be given. Students earning
a score of 6 or higher on the International Baccalaureate (IB) portfolio
will receive placement only (PL) for ARTS 104. Students who score a 5 on
the IB may petition for a portfolio review to determine if they can exempt
ARTS 102 or ARTS 104.
Advanced Placement by Portfolio Review
In addition to the threshold scores mentioned above, art majors who
have broad experience in visual art may petition to exempt foundation
requirements by submitting a portfolio for review. If the review is
successful, students do not receive credit for these courses; rather, the
credit hours are redistributed to the studio concentration or elective
requirement of the major. Portfolio requirements are modeled after the
College Board Advanced Placement portfolio guidelines. These guidelines
are available from the director of undergraduate studies in studio art,
the student services administrator, or on the art majors’ Sakai site.
Portfolios are reviewed annually in September. Contact the director of
undergraduate studies in studio art at the beginning of the fall semester
to make arrangements.

Advising

All majors and minors have a primary academic advisor in Steele
Building. Students are strongly encouraged to meet regularly with
their advisor and review their Tar Heel Tracker each semester. The
department’s directors of undergraduate studies and undergraduate
advisors work with current and prospective majors by appointment (see
“Contact Information” above). On request, art history majors may be
assigned an individual faculty advisor. The studio area also holds general
advising sessions prior to registration each semester. Departmental
academic advising is particularly important for those majors who are
considering honors thesis work or graduate school. Further information
on courses, undergraduate research opportunities, and the honors
program may be obtained from the department’s Web site.

Additionally, special informational sessions are held periodically to
guide students on awards, study abroad, internships, and research
opportunities (especially the Summer Undergraduate Research
Fellowships). These sessions are announced on the art majors' listserv
and Sakai site, as well as by posters in the Hanes Art Center and Art Lab.

Facilities

The department possesses outstanding facilities for the teaching of both
art history and studio art in the Hanes Art Center. The building houses
state-of-the-art facilities for image projection required in art history.
Specialized classrooms for art practice include large studios for painting,
drawing, and mixed media. A dedicated space is available for installation
projects. The John C. Henry Printmaking Studio is a wonderfully spacious
3,325 square foot laboratory providing ambient work space for a variety
of printmaking processes. Studios for photography include both wet
(black and white) and digital photography and a dedicated shooting
studio. The digital laboratories at UNC–Chapel Hill are Mac-based, with
the most current software needed for work in photography (including
large-scale output), video, and digital/electronic media. Students enrolled
in studio art classes have 24-hour access to these laboratories. In
addition, the 17,686 square-foot Art Lab, located 1.8 miles north of the
Hanes Art Center (108 Airport Drive), houses the department’s sculpture
facilities.

Department of Art resources also include the Joseph C. Sloane Art Library
with its collection of 100,000 volumes, which is supplemented by the

University’s Academic Affairs Libraries, with holdings of more than six
million volumes. The department’s Visual Resources Library contains
250,000 slides, 40,000 photographs, and 20,000 digitized images. The
University’s Ackland Art Museum is located adjacent to the Hanes Art
Center. The Ackland’s programming regularly augments the educational
experience of the University community.

The John and June Allcott Galleries in the Hanes Art Center are sites
for numerous exhibitions throughout the year. The main gallery has an
exhibition schedule of 12 to 15 shows each year, including the annual
award and graduation shows of undergraduate work as well as work by
professional artists, faculty members, and graduate students. The John
and June Allcott Undergraduate Gallery is the exhibition space designed
especially for work produced or chosen by undergraduate students. The
Alumni Sculpture Garden occupies the grounds surrounding the Hanes
Art Center. Temporary exhibitions of sculpture are commissioned by the
department and are on display for a two-year period. Commissions are
awarded annually to undergraduate and graduate students.

ARTS–Studio Art

Registration for the studio art foundation courses (ARTS 102, ARTS 103,
and ARTS 106) is limited to studio art majors and minors during the
first part of the preregistration period. Remaining spaces are made
available to nonmajors during the registration period for first-year
students. Because the department gives this preference to studio art
majors, nonmajors, undeclared students, or continuing study students
often find it difficult to enroll in these courses. Individuals seriously
considering a studio art major and experiencing such difficulty should
see the undergraduate advisor for studio art. We reserve a small number
of spaces for such students. Students may be asked to demonstrate a
commitment to studio art with some examples of artwork. Students are
also encouraged to contact instructors directly to secure a position on a
waiting list.

In general, studio art courses are numbered to reflect media areas in the
last digit. Painting courses end in 2, sculpture 3, drawing 4, photography
5, digital media 6, mixed media 7, and printmaking 8.

The undergraduate program in art history is directed toward two main
educational goals:

1. to provide students with an excellent liberal arts foundation through

an understanding of the historical and global significance, cultural

diversity, and intellectual richness of human artistic traditions from
prehistoric times to the present; and

2. to provide these students with the intellectual tools needed to

investigate the complex roles played by the arts in a variety of social
contexts.

Skills in visual analysis, historical research, critical reading, analytical and
descriptive writing, and oral communication are developed throughout
the course of the study. The practice of art history is interdisciplinary,
dynamically engaged with many fields in the humanities and social
sciences, as well as with the University’s diverse area studies programs
and the Ackland Art Museum. The art history major equips students
with skills, knowledge, and values to negotiate rapidly changing, richly
diverse, and increasingly interconnected local, national, and worldwide
communities.

Honors in Art History

The honors program is open to students with a 3.3 grade point average
who have demonstrated overall excellence in the discipline. Honors
are generally pursued in the senior year. Students enroll in the honors
courses (ARTH 691H in the fall; ARTH 692H in the spring) through
the student services assistant in the Department of Art office. This
should be done after consultation with the faculty honors advisor and
department honors advisor. For more information, see the honors
program description elsewhere in this catalog and the departmental
honors announcement. Honors work will allow a student to graduate with
honors or with highest honors.

Special Opportunities in Art
Independent Study
Students may pursue independent study coursework with individual
faculty members. Such work may be undertaken only with the permission
of the sponsoring faculty member. Students should consult individual
faculty members prior to registration to secure permission. A proposal
and a contract must be approved by the director of undergraduate
studies before students may enroll. The independent study syllabus
and contract are available on the art majors’ Sakai site. Since faculty

members are limited to supervising only two independent study students
each semester, students are strongly advised to contact the faculty
member with whom they wish to work early in the registration period for
the upcoming semester.

Independent study work requires a minimum of three hours per week per
credit hour. For example, a typical three-credit-hour class would require
at least nine hours of work per week. Once the semester begins, students
must meet with the faculty member initially to confirm goals, review
expectations, and establish semester deadlines. Thereafter, students
must meet regularly to review work in progress, with a suggested
biweekly frequency. Total time spent in direct interaction with the faculty
member for the semester must average 45 minutes per week. This may
be in the form of face-to-face meetings, blog or e-mail exchanges, or
group critiques with other independent study students and their advisors.
Departmental Involvement
Students have opportunities to see and interact with professional artists
and their work through exhibitions in the Allcott Galleries, installations
of sculptural works in the Alumni Sculpture Garden, artist-in-residence
programs, and the Hanes Visiting Artist Lecture Series.

There are several undergraduate student organizations serving the
visual arts at Carolina. The Undergraduate Art Association (UAA) is a
campuswide social club that supports and develops undergraduate
visual artists at Carolina regardless of their enrollment in art classes,
and strengthens the impact of visual art in the University community.
The Studio Art Majors Association (SAMA) is aimed specifically at
developing community and professional opportunities that augment the
experience for studio majors. ArtHeels is a service-based organization
that is passionate about bringing arts (visual, performing, and literary) to
the healthcare setting. The Art History Liaisons is the undergraduate art
history group. Kappa Pi is the art majors honors society which includes
both studio and art history majors. These groups serve as an important
link between the majors and the department’s administration. The
department utilizes these organizations to facilitate communication
about matters of interest, including participation in departmental
initiatives or other extracurricular opportunities.
Internships
Students are encouraged to pursue internships at local, regional, or
national arts institutions. Information about internship opportunities
is available in the department office. Just as with independent study,
students must have internships preapproved and under contract before
enrolling for ARTS 493.
Study Abroad
Students are encouraged to pursue study abroad opportunities. While
there are many opportunities to study art abroad, the Department of Art
maintains a special affiliation with the Studio Art Centers International
(SACI) and the Lorenzo di Medici–both in Florence, Italy–and the
Glasgow School of Art in Scotland. Students should discuss their study
abroad plans with the undergraduate adviser in studio art to obtain
prior approval for courses taken abroad. Basically, courses that have
an equivalent in the UNC–Chapel Hill curriculum usually are approved.
Courses that fall outside the UNC–Chapel Hill curriculum must be
evaluated on a case-by-case basis. No guarantee exists that a course will
transfer for credit unless preapproved. Contact the Study Abroad Office
to discuss the procedures for approval.

Undergraduate Awards
Undergraduate Scholarship Awards in Studio Art
A competition each November encourages studio art majors to submit
up to four works to be considered for the following scholarships: The
Alexander Julian Prize (one award to our best student), the Sharpe
Scholarships (multiple awards for students receiving financial aid),
George Kachergis Studio Art Scholarships (multiple awards chosen by
a student-designated committee), the Anderson Award, the Penland
School of Craft Scholarships (two awards cover expenses for a summer
course at the Penland School of Craft), and a design honorarium to
develop proposals for the Alumni Sculpture Garden (see below). The
studio program awards over $24,000 annually and awards range from a
minimum of $500 to $3,000.

Alumni Sculpture Garden Commission
The Department of Art annually commissions new works for the Alumni
Sculpture Garden. Students wishing to be considered for the commission
will indicate their interest during the Undergraduate Studio Art Awards
Competition. Students selected during the competition are paid an
honorarium to develop a design proposal. These proposals are evaluated
and approved by a faculty-designated panel. Selected finalists receive
a commission to realize the work. Most projects are sculptural but can
be experimental, temporary performative works, projections, or other
projects that utilize the Alumni Sculpture Garden spaces around the
Hanes Art Center.
Undergraduate Research
Opportunities for undergraduate research in the Department of Art exist
in several forms. Detailed descriptions and application guidelines are
available on the art majors’ Sakai site and from the student services
representative in the Department of Art office.

Allcott Travel Fellowships support two summer research projects in
studio art and/or art history.

The Pearman Fund supports special projects in both art history and
studio art. Competitions for art history research funds are held in the
fall and the spring. Studio art students may request funds for special
projects by submitting a proposal to the director of undergraduate
studies in studio art. Awards are generally $500 or less.

SURF Fellowships and the James Boyd Gadson Summer Fellowships
in Studio Art award up to $3,000 for studio art research projects. These
are specially designated Summer Undergraduate Research Fellowships
(SURF) administered through the UNC Office for Undergraduate
Research. SURF applications from studio art majors are automatically
considered for the Gadson Fellowships. This fund typically supports at
least two awards. Application deadlines (usually in February) are set by
the Office for Undergraduate Research. Students interested in pursuing
summer research should contact faculty sponsors toward the end of the
fall semester.

The Jacquelyn Friedman and Marvin Saltzman Fund in Art provides
supplemental monies for painting supplies for students who for
economic reasons may be hindered from working to their full potential.
Any undergraduate student with need, regardless of major, enrolled
in a Department of Art painting class during the fall and/or spring
semesters is eligible. Students should see their course instructor for
further information.

The B.A. degree is intended to expose undergraduate students to a
range of studio art ideas and practices. Students should choose this
degree option if they are seeking a general liberal arts education. It is also
the most-often selected degree option when pursuing a double major.
Second majors are frequent with communication studies (media and
technology studies and production), journalism (design track), biology,
drama (costume and set design), and psychology (art therapy), but any
field can be augmented by studying the visual arts. All General Education
Foundations, Approaches, Connections, and Supplemental General
Education requirements must be satisfied. While the major consists of 36
credit hours, students may earn up to 45 credits in the Department of Art
that will count toward graduation. Credits taken in the Department of Art
beyond 45 will not count toward overall graduation requirements.

Honors in Studio Art

The honors program in studio art is designed to provide senior majors
an opportunity to pursue serious and substantial work culminating in a
senior honors project. Successful completion of the project qualifies the
student to graduate with honors or with highest honors. Studio art majors
with a grade point average of 3.3 or above are eligible for consideration.
Admission to the studio art honors program is determined by a review of
work by a designated faculty committee. For this review students must
submit the following application materials:

• A completed application form,
• A written statement regarding the work, and
• A digital portfolio.

The work must demonstrate a mature capability to perform visual
research. Applications are reviewed each spring, in early April, for rising
seniors.

If accepted as a studio art honors candidate, students enroll in the
honors courses (ARTS 691H in the fall and ARTS 692H in the spring)
through the student services assistant. ARTS 691H and ARTS 692H
run concurrently with ARTS 499 and ARTS 500, and replace these
course requirements for the B.F.A. major. In addition to the scheduled
coursework, studio honors students select a thesis committee consisting
of a thesis adviser–who must be a studio art faculty member–and
two additional faculty members, one of whom must be a studio art
faculty member. In studio art, the thesis is the creative work produced.
Students also must write an accompanying artist’s statement. Completed
honors project work is presented to the honors committee for an oral
defense. On the basis of this defense and the work presented, the

committee determines whether or not a student graduates with an
honors designation (honors or highest honors.) A selection of work from
the senior honors thesis project is also presented in the Senior Exhibition
required for B.F.A. students.

Details of the application process and requirements for the honors
project are available on the studio art majors’ Sakai site.

B.F.A. students should be aware that courses taken in the Department
of Art beyond the 60 credits outlined in the major will not count toward
graduation.

All General Education Foundations, Approaches, and Connections
requirements must be satisfied.

Honors in Studio Art

The honors program in studio art is designed to provide senior majors
an opportunity to pursue serious and substantial work culminating in a
senior honors project. Successful completion of the project qualifies the
student to graduate with honors or with highest honors. Studio art majors
with a grade point average of 3.3 or above are eligible for consideration.
Admission to the studio art honors program is determined by a review of
work by a designated faculty committee. For this review students must
submit the following application materials:

• A completed application form,
• A written statement regarding the work, and
• A digital portfolio.

The work must demonstrate a mature capability to perform visual
research. Applications are reviewed each spring, in early April, for rising
seniors.

If accepted as a studio art honors candidate, students enroll in the
honors courses (ARTS 691H in the fall and ARTS 692H in the spring)
through the student services assistant. ARTS 691H and ARTS 692H
run concurrently with ARTS 499 and ARTS 500, and replace these
course requirements for the B.F.A. major. In addition to the scheduled
coursework, studio honors students select a thesis committee consisting
of a thesis adviser–who must be a studio art faculty member–and
two additional faculty members, one of whom must be a studio art
faculty member. In studio art, the thesis is the creative work produced.
Students also must write an accompanying artist’s statement. Completed
honors project work is presented to the honors committee for an oral
defense. On the basis of this defense and the work presented, the
committee determines whether or not a student graduates with an
honors designation (honors or highest honors.) A selection of work from
the senior honors thesis project is also presented in the Senior Exhibition
required for B.F.A. students.

Details of the application process and requirements for the honors
project are available on the studio art majors’ Sakai site.

Special Opportunities in Art
Independent Study
Students may pursue independent study coursework with individual
faculty members. Such work may be undertaken only with the permission
of the sponsoring faculty member. Students should consult individual
faculty members prior to registration to secure permission. A proposal
and a contract must be approved by the director of undergraduate
studies before students may enroll. The independent study syllabus
and contract are available on the art majors’ Sakai site. Since faculty
members are limited to supervising only two independent study students
each semester, students are strongly advised to contact the faculty

University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill            201

member with whom they wish to work early in the registration period for
the upcoming semester.

Independent study work requires a minimum of three hours per week per
credit hour. For example, a typical three-credit-hour class would require
at least nine hours of work per week. Once the semester begins, students
must meet with the faculty member initially to confirm goals, review
expectations, and establish semester deadlines. Thereafter, students
must meet regularly to review work in progress, with a suggested
biweekly frequency. Total time spent in direct interaction with the faculty
member for the semester must average 45 minutes per week. This may
be in the form of face-to-face meetings, blog or e-mail exchanges, or
group critiques with other independent study students and their advisors.
Departmental Involvement
Students have opportunities to see and interact with professional artists
and their work through exhibitions in the Allcott Galleries, installations
of sculptural works in the Alumni Sculpture Garden, artist-in-residence
programs, and the Hanes Visiting Artist Lecture Series.

There are several undergraduate student organizations serving the
visual arts at Carolina. The Undergraduate Art Association (UAA) is a
campuswide social club that supports and develops undergraduate
visual artists at Carolina regardless of their enrollment in art classes,
and strengthens the impact of visual art in the University community.
The Studio Art Majors Association (SAMA) is aimed specifically at
developing community and professional opportunities that augment the
experience for studio majors. ArtHeels is a service-based organization
that is passionate about bringing arts (visual, performing, and literary) to
the healthcare setting. The Art History Liaisons is the undergraduate art
history group. Kappa Pi is the art majors honors society which includes
both studio and art history majors. These groups serve as an important
link between the majors and the department’s administration. The
department utilizes these organizations to facilitate communication
about matters of interest, including participation in departmental
initiatives or other extracurricular opportunities.
Internships
Students are encouraged to pursue internships at local, regional, or
national arts institutions. Information about internship opportunities
is available in the department office. Just as with independent study,
students must have internships preapproved and under contract before
enrolling for ARTS 493.
Study Abroad
Students are encouraged to pursue study abroad opportunities. While
there are many opportunities to study art abroad, the Department of Art
maintains a special affiliation with the Studio Art Centers International
(SACI) and the Lorenzo di Medici–both in Florence, Italy–and the
Glasgow School of Art in Scotland. Students should discuss their study
abroad plans with the undergraduate adviser in studio art to obtain
prior approval for courses taken abroad. Basically, courses that have
an equivalent in the UNC–Chapel Hill curriculum usually are approved.
Courses that fall outside the UNC–Chapel Hill curriculum must be
evaluated on a case-by-case basis. No guarantee exists that a course will
transfer for credit unless preapproved. Contact the Study Abroad Office
to discuss the procedures for approval.
Undergraduate Awards
Undergraduate Scholarship Awards in Studio Art
A competition each November encourages studio art majors to submit
up to four works to be considered for the following scholarships: The

202         Studio Art Major, Bachelor of Fine Arts (B.F.A)–Art History Emphasis

Alexander Julian Prize (one award to our best student), the Sharpe
Scholarships (multiple awards for students receiving financial aid),
George Kachergis Studio Art Scholarships (multiple awards chosen by
a student-designated committee), the Anderson Award, the Penland
School of Craft Scholarships (two awards cover expenses for a summer
course at the Penland School of Craft), and a design honorarium to
develop proposals for the Alumni Sculpture Garden (see below). The
studio program awards over $24,000 annually and awards range from a
minimum of $500 to $3,000.

Alumni Sculpture Garden Commission
The Department of Art annually commissions new works for the Alumni
Sculpture Garden. Students wishing to be considered for the commission
will indicate their interest during the Undergraduate Studio Art Awards
Competition. Students selected during the competition are paid an
honorarium to develop a design proposal. These proposals are evaluated
and approved by a faculty-designated panel. Selected finalists receive
a commission to realize the work. Most projects are sculptural but can
be experimental, temporary performative works, projections, or other
projects that utilize the Alumni Sculpture Garden spaces around the
Hanes Art Center.
Undergraduate Research
Opportunities for undergraduate research in the Department of Art exist
in several forms. Detailed descriptions and application guidelines are
available on the art majors’ Sakai site and from the student services
representative in the Department of Art office.

Allcott Travel Fellowships support two summer research projects in
studio art and/or art history.

The Pearman Fund supports special projects in both art history and
studio art. Competitions for art history research funds are held in the
fall and the spring. Studio art students may request funds for special
projects by submitting a proposal to the director of undergraduate
studies in studio art. Awards are generally $500 or less.

SURF Fellowships and the James Boyd Gadson Summer Fellowships
in Studio Art award up to $3,000 for studio art research projects. These
are specially designated Summer Undergraduate Research Fellowships
(SURF) administered through the UNC Office for Undergraduate
Research. SURF applications from studio art majors are automatically
considered for the Gadson Fellowships. This fund typically supports at
least two awards. Application deadlines (usually in February) are set by
the Office for Undergraduate Research. Students interested in pursuing
summer research should contact faculty sponsors toward the end of the
fall semester.

The Jacquelyn Friedman and Marvin Saltzman Fund in Art provides
supplemental monies for painting supplies for students who for
economic reasons may be hindered from working to their full potential.
Any undergraduate student with need, regardless of major, enrolled
in a Department of Art painting class during the fall and/or spring
semesters is eligible. Students should see their course instructor for
further information.

This combined degree was designed for those wishing a depth of study in
both programmatic areas of the Department of Art.

The bachelor of fine arts with art history emphasis degree was
established to allow students to pursue concentrated study in both
studio art and art history. Unique to UNC–Chapel Hill, this degree has
been well received for students wishing to pursue graduate study in fields
that demand knowledge in both history and practice, such as curatorial
studies, museum studies, or education. Students pursuing this degree
are advised by the director of undergraduate studies for both studio art
and art history. Students interested in this degree should contact both
advisors no later than the sophomore year.

The art history curriculum is designed to help students acquire an
individual perspective on their own values and beliefs and on their places
in a society increasingly shaped by visual communication. Majors and
minors in art history become acquainted with the historical significance,
cultural diversity, and intellectual richness of human artistic traditions,
enabling students to investigate the complex roles played by the arts in a
variety of social contexts.

Students majoring in the Department of Asian Studies also may pursue a

Advising

All majors and minors have a primary academic advisor in Steele
Building. Students are strongly encouraged to meet regularly with their
advisor and review their Tar Heel Tracker each semester. All majors
are also required to meet each fall with a faculty advisor within the
department. Departmental advising is an opportunity to discuss major
progress, course selection and planning, study abroad, graduate school,
career opportunities, and other matters pertinent to the major field.
Advisors are assigned by concentration; advisor listings and contact
information may be found on the department’s Web site and are also
disseminated via the majors’ listserv.

Facilities

Students taking courses in the Department of Asian Studies have support
for their work through the Language Resource Center (LRC), housed on
the ground floor of Dey Hall. The LRC provides resources and services
for language teaching and learning, including audio and video materials;
smart classrooms with PCs and projection equipment; listening, viewing,
and recording facilities; a walk-in computer lab; and online databases for
language learning.

to read and think analytically and to present their ideas effectively
orally and in writing, essential preparation for a variety of careers and
for the responsibilities of living in an interdependent world. Graduates
of the program have continued their academic preparation in top-

under the guidance of a faculty member. While researching and writing

232         Asian Studies Major, B.A.–Arab Cultures Concentration

the honors paper, the student will enroll in ASIA 691H and ASIA 692H.
ASIA 692H may count as one of the interdisciplinary courses for the
major; ASIA 691H will count for elective credit only. In the case of the
concentrations in Arab cultures, Chinese, Japanese, and South Asian
studies, ASIA 692H may count toward the major in the concentration.

A committee composed of at least two faculty members will examine the
candidate. To be accepted as an honors candidate, a student must meet
the University’s requirement of a minimum overall grade point average
of 3.3, secure the consent of a faculty member in the Asian studies field
to act as advisor for the project, and submit a proposal to the associate
chair of Asian studies for approval.
Departmental Involvement
The department sponsors a variety of cultural events—lectures, film
series, performances, and more—as well as social and informational
events where students can get to know each other and faculty members
in an informal setting. Faculty members in the department serve as
advisors to some of the many Asia-related student organizations on
campus, such as the Japan Club, Chinese Conversation Club, and more.
Languages across the Curriculum
The department participates in the Languages across the Curriculum
(LAC) program, offering a one-credit-hour discussion section that is
conducted in Arabic but associated with a variety of courses offered in
English, both in Asian studies and in such other departments as history
or religious studies. This LAC recitation section offers students the
opportunity to use their Arabic language skills in a broader intellectual
context.
Libraries
The University has rich collections of books and periodicals on Asia in
the relevant Asian languages, as well as in English and other Western
languages. Experts in the collection development department for Davis
Library are available to help students locate the materials they need. The
University also has an outstanding collection of Asian films and other
audiovisual materials, housed in the Media Resource Center at House
Library.
Speaker Series
The department sponsors an annual speaker series. These events
include lectures by prominent artists, scholars, and writers and are often
cosponsored by other units on campus.
Study Abroad
UNC–Chapel Hill sponsors several study programs (summer, semester,
and yearlong) in China, Egypt, India, Israel, Japan, Jordan, Korea,
Mongolia, Morocco, Nepal, Oman, Singapore, Taiwan, Thailand, Turkey,
and Vietnam. Asian studies majors are strongly encouraged to take
advantage of these opportunities to live and study in an Asian setting;
UNC-approved study abroad programs also satisfy the experiential
education requirement. For further information on these programs and
other study abroad opportunities in Asia, contact the UNC Study Abroad
Office.
Undergraduate Research
The department actively encourages undergraduate student research.
Through classes, advising, and office hours, faculty members guide
students toward defining areas of interest, conceptualizing research
questions, identifying sources, and writing academic papers. Students
may pursue research through independent studies, the senior honors

thesis, and study abroad research opportunities such as the Burch
Fellowship. Asian studies students have received a variety of competitive
research support and travel awards, won regional contests for
undergraduate papers, published papers in academic journals, and
presented their work at such events as the Senior Colloquium in Asian
Studies and the campuswide Annual Celebration of Undergraduate
Research in the spring.

Placement credit (PL) may not be used to meet core requirements for the
concentration.

With the approval of the associate chair of Asian studies, a student
may count a course in directed readings (ASIA 496 or CHIN 496) in the
concentration in Chinese. To register for ASIA 496 or CHIN 496, a student
must obtain the approval of the associate chair and the faculty member
who will supervise the project.

Of the eight courses in the concentration in Chinese, at least six must be
passed with a grade of C (not C-) or better. No course in the concentration
may be declared Pass/Fail.

Special Opportunities in Asian Studies
Honors in Asian Studies
A candidate for honors in Asian studies will write a substantial paper
under the guidance of a faculty member. While researching and writing
the honors paper, the student will enroll in ASIA 691H and ASIA 692H.
ASIA 692H may count as one of the interdisciplinary courses for the
major; ASIA 691H will count for elective credit only. In the case of the
concentrations in Arab cultures, Chinese, Japanese, and South Asian
studies, ASIA 692H may count toward the major in the concentration.

A committee composed of at least two faculty members will examine the
candidate. To be accepted as an honors candidate, a student must meet
the University’s requirement of a minimum overall grade point average
of 3.3, secure the consent of a faculty member in the Asian studies field
to act as advisor for the project, and submit a proposal to the associate
chair of Asian studies for approval.
Departmental Involvement
The department sponsors a variety of cultural events—lectures, film
series, performances, and more—as well as social and informational
events where students can get to know each other and faculty members
in an informal setting. Faculty members in the department serve as
advisors to some of the many Asia-related student organizations on
campus, such as the Japan Club, Chinese Conversation Club, and more.
Languages across the Curriculum
The department participates in the Languages across the Curriculum
(LAC) program, offering a one-credit-hour discussion section that is
conducted in Arabic but associated with a variety of courses offered in
English, both in Asian studies and in such other departments as history
or religious studies. This LAC recitation section offers students the
opportunity to use their Arabic language skills in a broader intellectual
context.
Libraries
The University has rich collections of books and periodicals on Asia in
the relevant Asian languages, as well as in English and other Western
languages. Experts in the collection development department for Davis

Library are available to help students locate the materials they need. The
University also has an outstanding collection of Asian films and other
audiovisual materials, housed in the Media Resource Center at House
Library.
Speaker Series
The department sponsors an annual speaker series. These events
include lectures by prominent artists, scholars, and writers and are often
cosponsored by other units on campus.
Study Abroad
UNC–Chapel Hill sponsors several study programs (summer, semester,
and yearlong) in China, Egypt, India, Israel, Japan, Jordan, Korea,
Mongolia, Morocco, Nepal, Oman, Singapore, Taiwan, Thailand, Turkey,
and Vietnam. Asian studies majors are strongly encouraged to take
advantage of these opportunities to live and study in an Asian setting;
UNC-approved study abroad programs also satisfy the experiential
education requirement. For further information on these programs and
other study abroad opportunities in Asia, contact the UNC Study Abroad
Office.
Undergraduate Research
The department actively encourages undergraduate student research.
Through classes, advising, and office hours, faculty members guide
students toward defining areas of interest, conceptualizing research
questions, identifying sources, and writing academic papers. Students
may pursue research through independent studies, the senior honors
thesis, and study abroad research opportunities such as the Burch
Fellowship. Asian studies students have received a variety of competitive
research support and travel awards, won regional contests for
undergraduate papers, published papers in academic journals, and
presented their work at such events as the Senior Colloquium in Asian
Studies and the campuswide Annual Celebration of Undergraduate
Research in the spring.

context.
Libraries
The University has rich collections of books and periodicals on Asia in
the relevant Asian languages, as well as in English and other Western
languages. Experts in the collection development department for Davis
Library are available to help students locate the materials they need. The
University also has an outstanding collection of Asian films and other
audiovisual materials, housed in the Media Resource Center at House
Library.
Speaker Series
The department sponsors an annual speaker series. These events
include lectures by prominent artists, scholars, and writers and are often
cosponsored by other units on campus.
Study Abroad
UNC–Chapel Hill sponsors several study programs (summer, semester,
and yearlong) in China, Egypt, India, Israel, Japan, Jordan, Korea,
Mongolia, Morocco, Nepal, Oman, Singapore, Taiwan, Thailand, Turkey,
and Vietnam. Asian studies majors are strongly encouraged to take
advantage of these opportunities to live and study in an Asian setting;
UNC-approved study abroad programs also satisfy the experiential
education requirement. For further information on these programs and
other study abroad opportunities in Asia, contact the UNC Study Abroad
Office.
Undergraduate Research
The department actively encourages undergraduate student research.
Through classes, advising, and office hours, faculty members guide
students toward defining areas of interest, conceptualizing research
questions, identifying sources, and writing academic papers. Students
may pursue research through independent studies, the senior honors
thesis, and study abroad research opportunities such as the Burch
Fellowship. Asian studies students have received a variety of competitive
research support and travel awards, won regional contests for
undergraduate papers, published papers in academic journals, and
presented their work at such events as the Senior Colloquium in Asian
Studies and the campuswide Annual Celebration of Undergraduate
Research in the spring.

Introduction

Biology is the study of life from both basic and applied perspectives
across a broad range of analytical levels, from the molecule and cell
to the organism and ecosystem. The major in biology provides a broad
education directed toward an appreciation of the complexity of nature,
and prepares students for careers in the biological, environmental,
and medical sciences. The B.S. and B.A. majors in biology prepare
students for careers in the health professions (including medical, dental,
and veterinary) and in research or teaching in institutions of higher
education, government, and private industry. Departmental majors
gain a firm foundation in essential areas of biology through the core
curriculum and have ample choices for study in various specialized
subjects. A quantitative biology track in the B.S. major provides training
in interdisciplinary computational approaches to studying biological
questions. The department offers many opportunities for mentored
undergraduate research and internships.

Advising

The biology department offers intensive advising services for our
undergraduate students. The departmental advisor, Dr. Gidi Shemer
(bishemer@email.unc.edu) (213A Coker Hall), will be happy to assist with
course planning, career development, finding research opportunities,
and any other question or concern with regards to the major. Biology
majors interested in study abroad should contact Dr. Elaine Yeh
(yeh@email.unc.edu) to learn about opportunities and transfer credits.
For general assistance with registration in courses and various forms,
please contact the biology undergraduate student services registrar, Ms.
Summer Montgomery (sundance@unc.edu) in 213 Coker Hall.

Facilities

The Department of Biology occupies parts of four buildings: Wilson
Hall and its annex, Coker Hall, Fordham Hall, and the Genome Sciences
Building. The department is served by the Kenan Science Library, located
in Venable Hall and Wilson Annex, which provides research information
services and resources for the basic sciences. In addition, the department

has greenhouses on the fifth floor of the Genome Sciences Building,
a microscopy facility that contains three confocal microscopes and
associated support facilities, a P3 laboratory, a small-mammal facility,
insect culturing rooms, marine aquaria, and a microarray facility.

Graduate School and Career Opportunities

Those who plan careers in health sciences, including dentistry, medicine,
and veterinary medicine, should consult with advisors in the Health
Professions Advising Office in Hanes Hall. Those interested in science
teaching can take the educational coursework required for a high school
science teaching license through the UNC Baccalaureate Education
in Science and Teaching (UNC–BEST (http://www.unc.edu/uncbest))
program. Special courses in marine science are offered through the
Department of Biology and the Department of Marine Sciences at the
Institute of Marine Sciences, Morehead City, NC.

Biology Major, NUS Joint Degree

Biology B.S. majors may wish to consider applying for the Joint Degree
Program, an innovative joint undergraduate degree program between the
University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and the National University of
Singapore. UNC–Chapel Hill undergraduates spend anywhere from two to
four semesters at the National University of Singapore and receive a joint
bachelor of science degree from both institutions. For further information,
contact the Study Abroad Office.

Special Opportunities in Biology

Students are encouraged to speak with their advisor about opportunities
to serve as peer advisors in the Health Professions Advising Office, or to
join Tri-Beta, the National Biological Sciences Honor Society.
Honors in Biology
Candidates for honors or highest honors must secure approval from the
departmental honors advisor. They must have three hours of BIOL 395,
take BIOL 692H, and maintain a grade point average of 3.3, both overall
and in biology courses (exclusive of BIOL 692H and including only one
semester of BIOL 395), calculated at the end of the semester preceding
the semester in which they graduate. Other requirements are detailed on
the department Web site (http://bio.unc.edu/undergraduate/honors-info).
Experiential Education
After completing BIOL 201 or BIOL 202, students are encouraged to
consider how they plan to meet the experiential education requirement.
BIOL 293, BIOL 295, and BIOL 395 all fulfill this requirement and also

connect students’ academic coursework to current biological research
and inquiry.
UNC–BEST
The UNC Baccalaureate Education in Science and Teaching (UNC–BEST)
Program is a collaboration between the School of Education and the
College of Arts and Sciences and is designed to allow undergraduate
science majors interested in teaching high school science the
opportunity to earn their science degree and obtain licensure as a North
Carolina high school science teacher in four years. UNC–BEST students
meet all the degree requirements for their biology degree using BIOL 410
as one of their upper-level biology courses. UNC–BEST students also
fulfill teaching licensure coursework requirements as well as many
General Education and elective requirements as they complete 10
credit hours in teaching and learning, including EDUC 516 or EDUC 689
or EDUC 690, EDUC 532, and EDUC 615. During their final semester,
students engage in a full-time student teaching internship (EDUC 593)
and participate in an education leadership seminar (EDUC 601). For more
details on admission requirements, application deadlines, and submitting
an online application, visit the program's Web site (http://soe.unc.edu/
academics/uncbest).
Laboratory Teaching Apprenticeships and
Assistantships
Opportunities exist for assisting graduate instructors (and for instruction
in undergraduate laboratories). Interested students should contact the
instructor of the course or obtain approval from either the departmental
director of undergraduate studies or the department chair.
Undergraduate Awards
All awards include a personal plaque, a monetary gift, and a place on
Coker Hall’s list of department honorees. The awards include

• The Stephen G. Brantley Award in honor of Henry Van Peters Wilson,
given annually to a senior biology major for excellence in research in
molecular and cellular biology.

• The Robert Ervin Coker Award, given annually to a senior biology

major for excellence in research in organismal biology and ecology.
• The John N. Couch Award, given annually to a senior biology major

with interests in plant biology who has demonstrated the highest
ideals of scholarship and research.

• The Irvine R. Hagadorn Award, given annually to the junior biology
major based on academic and research excellence. This award is
also recognized by the UNC–Chapel Hill Chancellor at the Annual
Chancellor’s Awards Ceremony.

• The Francis J. LeClair Award, given annually to a senior biology

major for academic excellence in biology with an emphasis in plant
sciences.

Undergraduate Research
An undergraduate research experience is extremely valuable to a student
who intends to pursue postgraduate work in the biological sciences.
Undergraduates may participate directly in the research of faculty in
the Department of Biology. This research opportunity allows students
to put their knowledge of biology into practice through participation in
a biological research program and is encouraged by faculty. Students’
participation in research can begin as early as their second year by
registration in BIOL 395.

Undergraduates with a 3.0 or higher grade point average in biology
courses are encouraged to enroll in BIOL 395. Information concerning

the procedure for enrolling in a research course can be obtained from
the chair of the department’s undergraduate honors research program.
Additional information can be found on the department's Web site (http://
bio.unc.edu/undergraduate/research).

Biology is the study of life from both basic and applied perspectives
across a broad range of analytical levels, from the molecule and cell
to the organism and ecosystem. The major in biology provides a broad
education directed toward an appreciation of the complexity of nature
and prepares students for careers in the biological, environmental, and
medical sciences. This program is designed to provide greater flexibility
than the B.S. degree in meeting broad student interests.

Introduction

The joint Department of Biomedical Engineering (BME) is a department
of both the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (UNC–Chapel Hill)
and North Carolina State University (NC State). The department oversees
a joint graduate and undergraduate program at these institutions. While
a complete curriculum is offered on the UNC–Chapel Hill campus,
students can elect to take any number of classes at NC State. The joint
program also leverages the industry resources in Research Triangle Park,
located roughly half way between the two campuses, providing unique
opportunities for students.

Biomedical engineering is a profession that develops and applies
engineering knowledge and experience to solve problems in biology
and medicine and to enhance health care. Biomedical engineers are
professionally trained to combine the rigors of medical and biological
studies with the power of engineering analysis and design. People
become biomedical engineers to be of service to others, to enjoy the
excitement of understanding living systems, and to use state-of-the-
art science and technology to solve the complex problems of medical
care. The emphasis in biomedical engineering is on finding solutions by
researching, testing, and applying medical, biological, chemical, electrical,
and materials engineering approaches. Biomedical engineers are unique
individuals who make contributions to health care that are both satisfying
to themselves and beneficial to others.

Facilities

The Department of Biomedical Engineering houses an undergraduate
student design laboratory. It contains equipment for rapid prototyping
(three-dimensional printer and laser cutter), as well as electronics and
microcontroller design and development. Students also use facilities
in other departments that have laboratory-based courses. The BeAM
Makerspace facilities are available to all UNC students, and these
facilities house a variety of mechanical and electronic fabrication tools.
More information is available at the UNC BeAM Web site.

Graduate School and Career Opportunities

Many students from this program have pursued further education in
graduate school in biomedical engineering. Our alumni have attended
many of the top-ranked biomedical engineering programs. In addition,
some students have pursued graduate degrees in other disciplines
in engineering, as well as related fields such as microbiology, sports
physiology, public health, and business/engineering management, among
others. Students have also been accepted into clinical programs such
as medical, dental, physical therapy, and pharmacy schools (in many

University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill            277

cases, the student must take several additional courses to meet the
requirements for clinical programs).

For those interested in going directly into a career, biomedical
engineering is one of the fastest growing career opportunities. Graduates
are employed by hospitals, pharmaceutical companies, medical device
and testing companies, government agencies, universities, and medical
schools.

Advising

The department provides both curriculum advising and career advising.
BME curriculum advisors provide guidance on course and curriculum
issues. The advisors are a small group of faculty members and staff
who have expertise in the BME curriculum. Students can meet with any
of the curriculum advisors at any time. Starting in the sophomore year,
BME students must get their planned courses approved by a curriculum
advisor each semester in order to register for classes. Students can
also schedule a meeting with an advisor for additional assistance. The
department sends out instructions on this procedure every semester.

BME career advisors provide guidance on issues related to careers,

Departmental Involvement
Student organizations include the BME Club. This is an official UNC–
Chapel Hill club that organizes speakers, outreach to industry and the
medical school, and mentoring, among other activities. This is also a joint
club with the BME students at North Carolina State University.
Experiential Education
All students in biomedical engineering participate in a capstone design
experience in which they develop a device or system that has biomedical
applications. This project fulfills the General Education experiential
education requirement. There are also opportunities for experiential
education outside of the curriculum. These opportunities include Helping
Hands, which develops 3-D printed prosthetic hands, and Engineering
World Health, which develops medical equipment for under-resourced
populations.
Undergraduate Awards
Awards are given to students in the graduating class each spring.
Undergraduate Research
Students are strongly encouraged to undertake a research project at
any time during their education, but particularly during their junior and/
or senior years. Through the challenge of a research project, students
come face to face with the leading edge of an area, gain expertise
with state-of-the-art techniques and instrumentation, and experience a
professional scientific career firsthand. Many undergraduate students
work in the research laboratories of BME faculty members. In addition,
faculty across campus conduct BME-related research, and many
undergraduate students take advantage of these research opportunities
in the School of Medicine, School of Dentistry, School of Pharmacy,
and in the Departments of Biology, Chemistry, Physics and Astronomy,
Computer Science, and Exercise and Sport Science.

The BME department helps to coordinate research activities and
facilitates connections between students and research laboratories. This
is accomplished through communication via e-mail and the department
Web site. Also, the department organizes laboratory open houses,
enabling students to visit faculty laboratories and learn about their
research opportunities. The UNC–Chapel Hill Office for Undergraduate
Research is also an excellent resource for finding research opportunities.

Introduction

The Department of Biostatistics in the Gillings School of Global Public
Health was the first undergraduate program in the country to offer
an undergraduate degree in biostatistics. The degree provides an
excellent foundation for continued studies (primarily graduate school in
biostatistics, epidemiology, or medical school) and a strong foundation
for employment in the health care industry for highly qualified students
interested in quantitative methods applied to public health and medicine.

Advising

The program director serves as the academic advisor for all biostatistics
undergraduates. Undergraduate students are encouraged to meet
regularly with the program director and review their Tar Heel Tracker
each semester. In addition, they can also visit the Office of Student
Services. Departmental academic advising is particularly important for
those students who are considering proceeding to graduate school,
double majoring, or pursuing the dual B.S.P.H.–M.S. degree. Further
information may be obtained in the Academic Information Manual (http://
sph.unc.edu/bios/bios-degrees).

Facilities

The Department of Biostatistics has a student library, a student study
room, and computer facilities for its students.

Graduate School and Career Opportunities

In recent years, the majority of undergraduate biostatistics students from
this program have chosen to attend medical school or graduate school
in biostatistics (or other closely related fields) following graduation.
More than 65 percent of recent graduates have entered medical school
or graduate programs (primarily biostatistics) immediately following
graduation. Recent graduates are attending top-ranked medical schools
at Johns Hopkins University, Vanderbilt University, University of
Virginia, Duke University, and UNC–Chapel Hill. Biostatistics graduate
programs where students have matriculated immediately following
completion of this undergraduate program include the University of
Washington–Seattle, Harvard, UNC–Chapel Hill, and the University of
Michigan. Previous graduates who chose to seek employment have
taken positions in the pharmaceutical industry, contract research
organizations, and medical settings. Examples of employers of recent
graduates include Duke Clinical Research Institute, Blue Cross Blue
Shield, Rho, PPD, National Institutes of Environmental Health Science,
and Research Triangle Institute. Traditionally, career opportunities have
been outstanding for skilled biostatisticians.

undergraduates can pursue individualized study and undertake a special
project. Students who have a grade point average of 3.3 or higher are
eligible to participate in honors research and write an honors thesis.
Faculty members’ readiness to guide the students in their honors work
governs the final selection of those allowed to enter the program.
Students completing an honors program must register for BIOS 693H and
BIOS 694H.
Experiential Education
The required course, BIOS 664, fulfills the General Education experiential
education requirement. In addition, students are required to take
BIOS 691 during the fall semester of the senior year. This course consists
of an orientation to and observation of six or more major nonacademic
institutions in North Carolina’s Research Triangle Park area that employ
biostatisticians, including contract research organizations, nonprofit
companies, and government agencies. BIOS 691 does not fulfill the
General Education experiential education requirement.
Laboratory Teaching Internships and Assistantships
Students are encouraged to investigate part-time employment during the
academic year and full-time employment during the summer after their
junior year with members of our faculty and their collaborators on current
research and service projects.
Study Abroad
Students are encouraged to participate in the University’s study abroad
programs in the summers or before matriculating to the B.S.P.H. in
biostatistics program. Identification of a study abroad program early in
the student’s career is necessary for course planning purposes.
Undergraduate Awards
The Theta Chapter of Delta Omega honors up to 10 percent of the
department’s graduates with an award of excellence. Awards are

288         Biostatistics Major, B.S.P.H.

presented in the spring as part of the biostatistics awards ceremony.
Among the recent graduates, a notable proportion of students has been
inducted into Phi Beta Kappa.
Undergraduate Research
Students are encouraged to consider doing senior honors research and
should consult individual faculty members for opportunities. However,
some students choose to take advantage of the myriad part-time
employment opportunities with our faculty members on their research
and service projects or opportunities within nearby Research Triangle
Park.

Introduction

Chemistry is the scientific study of the composition and properties of
matter and the investigation of the laws that govern them. Classically,
chemistry is divided into several subdisciplines. Organic chemistry deals
primarily with carbon compounds; inorganic chemistry, with compounds
of the other elements. Physical chemistry seeks to describe relationships
between the chemical and physical properties of all substances.
Analytical chemistry studies the analysis of the chemical composition
of all substances. Biological chemistry pursues the chemistry of living
organisms. At the borders of these subdisciplines are many hybrid areas
of study: physical organic, organometallic, bioinorganic, and others. At
the interface of chemistry with other sciences, several active fields are
fueled by insights gained from two ways of thinking about things: for
example, chemical physics, chemical biology, organic geochemistry,
and the extensive chemical problems in biotechnology, nanotechnology,
material sciences, and molecular medicine. In all of these areas the
chemist’s approach may be theoretical, experimental, or both.

All chemists have a common core of knowledge, learned through a
highly structured sequence of undergraduate courses in which the
content is divided into the classical subdisciplines. Toward the end of
students’ progress through their four years of undergraduate study, they
may choose to concentrate in one or more areas of chemistry through
the courses selected to fulfill the chemistry elective requirements and
through undergraduate research.

Advising

Faculty advisors are available in the Department of Chemistry for
both walk-in meetings and scheduled advising appointments. The
departmental advisors assist students with a variety of areas: course
planning for the chemistry major, career/graduate school planning, study
abroad opportunities, undergraduate research opportunities, and how to
deal with academic difficulties. Chemistry majors are required to meet
with a departmental advisor by appointment prior to registering for any
semester beyond the fourth term in residence. The faculty advisors also
schedule many events for the majors.

Graduate School and Career Opportunities

An undergraduate degree tailored according to the student’s interests
can open doors to graduate programs in many academic disciplines:
chemistry, environmental science, materials science, polymer science,
chemical engineering, geochemistry, chemical physics, and several
disciplines at the interface between biology and chemistry. A technically
oriented administrator in the chemical industry might choose to obtain

a master’s degree in business administration. More than 100 schools in
the United States offer graduate programs in chemistry and related areas,
and the usual practice is to complete a graduate degree at an institution
different from the undergraduate institution. It is necessary to specialize
in graduate study, either within one of the branches previously mentioned
or at the interface between two of them. A student admitted to a graduate
program in chemistry in the United States is usually offered a teaching
assistantship or fellowship.

Chemists have a wide choice of academic, governmental, or industrial
positions. By far the greatest percentage accept industrial positions,
mostly in chemical manufacturing or the petroleum, food, and
pharmaceutical industries, where they may be developing new products
to benefit humanity or assessing the level of risk in the processes for
some proposed production methods, for example. Most government
chemists are employed in agriculture, health, energy, environmental, and
defense-related areas. In the academic field, with such a broad spectrum
of colleges and universities in this country, chemists can set career goals
with varying levels of emphasis on training students in research and
teaching in the classroom and instructional laboratory.

Course Sequencing

Careful attention should be given to prerequisites and course timing
when planning a long-term schedule. A C- or better grade in CHEM 101
is required to continue into CHEM 102/CHEM 102L. CHEM 102 is a
prerequisite for CHEM 241/CHEM 241L, CHEM 251, and CHEM 261. A C-
or better grade in CHEM 102 is required to continue into ANY higher-level
chemistry course. A C- or better grade in CHEM 261 is a prerequisite for
CHEM 262, and CHEM 241L is a prerequisite for CHEM 262L. Students
intending to take pregraduate or preprofessional exams (such as the GRE
or MCAT) should plan accordingly.

Upon the recommendation of the Department of Chemistry, the B.A. or
B.S. degree with a major in chemistry may be awarded with honors in
chemistry or highest honors in chemistry.

Highest honors in chemistry is a distinction bestowed on a truly
exceptional student who has excelled in coursework and who has
completed a research project of considerable depth and significance. To
attain this distinction the candidate must have nominally satisfied the
following guidelines:

• B.A. candidates must have achieved a chemistry major grade point
average of 3.85 or higher; B.S. candidates, a chemistry major grade
point average of 3.75 or higher.

• Have completed at least five courses in chemistry numbered

CHEM 420 or above. For B.A. candidates one of these may be a
laboratory course; for B.S. candidates they must all be lecture
courses.

• Have completed or be about to complete a research project certified
to be of publishable quality by the research advisor and two faculty
members appointed by the director of undergraduate studies

Honors in chemistry is a distinction bestowed on an outstanding student
who has demonstrated marked competence in the coursework and who
has completed a research project of considerable merit. To attain this
distinction the candidate must have nominally satisfied the following
guidelines:

• Have achieved a chemistry major grade point average of 3.40 or

higher

• Have received no grade below B- in junior- or senior-level chemistry

courses

students must be registered no later than the end of the first week of

so that ample time and effort may be devoted to succeeding in upper-
level courses and research.
Departmental Involvement
Majors are encouraged to participate in AXE (chemistry fraternity) and
the undergraduate advisory board.
Laboratory Teaching Internships and Assistantships
Undergraduates have the opportunity to serve as laboratory teaching
assistants for entry-level undergraduate laboratory courses.
Special Topics
Special topics not offered through the normal course sequence may be
pursued through directed reading and registration in CHEM 396 with the
approval of the supervising faculty member, advisor, and vice chair for
undergraduate studies. An approved learning contract is required, and

Undergraduate Research
Almost every undergraduate chemistry major who has undertaken a
research project has found it to be an exciting and rewarding experience.
The reasons are many. One certainly is that it affords an opportunity
to make pioneering discoveries at the forefront of science, using
instrumentation and techniques far more sophisticated than those
usually encountered in standard laboratory courses.

More than 80 students are involved in undergraduate research
projects in chemistry each year. Although successful completion of
an undergraduate research project is a requirement for graduation
with honors or highest honors (see above), it is not necessary to be a
participant in Honors Carolina to undertake a research project.

The usual mechanism for becoming involved in a research project is
to register for CHEM 395. This process begins well in advance of a
preregistration or registration period with a visit to the Chemistry Student
Services office, where a student may obtain a list of undergraduate
research opportunities and a form titled Request for Registration in
CHEM 395.

Most students begin research during the spring semester of their junior
year and continue throughout their senior year. CHEM 395 and CHEM 396

together may be taken for credit as many times as desired but may be
counted for no more than nine hours total credit toward graduation in
either the B.A. or B.S. traditional and polymer tracks and for no more than
six hours in the B.S. biochemistry track. In the B.S. curriculum CHEM 395
may be counted no more than once as an advanced chemistry elective.
UNC–BEST
The UNC Baccalaureate Education in Science and Teaching (UNC–BEST)
Program is a collaboration between the School of Education and the
College of Arts and Sciences and is designed to allow undergraduate
science majors interested in teaching high school science the
opportunity to earn their science degree and obtain licensure as a North
Carolina high school science teacher in four years. UNC–BEST students
meet all the degree requirements for their chemistry degree using
CHEM 410 as one of their upper-level chemistry courses. UNC–BEST
students also fulfill teaching licensure coursework requirements as well
as many General Education and elective requirements as they complete
10 credit hours in teaching and learning, including EDUC 516 or EDUC 689
or EDUC 690, EDUC 532, and EDUC 615. During their final semester
students engage in a full-time student teaching internship (EDUC 593)
and participate in an education leadership seminar (EDUC 601). For
more details on admission requirements, application deadlines, and
instructions for submitting an online application, visit the School of
Education Web site (http://soe.unc.edu/academics/uncbest).

Honors in Chemistry
Upon the recommendation of the Department of Chemistry, the B.A. or
B.S. degree with a major in chemistry may be awarded with honors in
chemistry or highest honors in chemistry.

Highest honors in chemistry is a distinction bestowed on a truly
exceptional student who has excelled in coursework and who has
completed a research project of considerable depth and significance. To
attain this distinction the candidate must have nominally satisfied the
following guidelines:

• B.A. candidates must have achieved a chemistry major grade point
average of 3.85 or higher; B.S. candidates, a chemistry major grade
point average of 3.75 or higher.

• Have completed at least five courses in chemistry numbered

CHEM 420 or above. For B.A. candidates one of these may be a
laboratory course; for B.S. candidates they must all be lecture
courses.

• Have completed or be about to complete a research project certified
to be of publishable quality by the research advisor and two faculty
members appointed by the director of undergraduate studies

Honors in chemistry is a distinction bestowed on an outstanding student
who has demonstrated marked competence in the coursework and who
has completed a research project of considerable merit. To attain this
distinction the candidate must have nominally satisfied the following
guidelines:

• Have achieved a chemistry major grade point average of 3.40 or

higher

• Have received no grade below B- in junior- or senior-level chemistry

courses

• Have completed at least three lecture courses in chemistry numbered

CHEM 420 or above

• Have completed or be about to complete a research project certified

to be of honors quality by the research advisor and two faculty
members appointed by the vice chair for undergraduate studies

Students who wish to qualify for either of these awards should begin
planning their course programs and research activities in the junior year
so that ample time and effort may be devoted to succeeding in upper-
level courses and research.
Departmental Involvement
Majors are encouraged to participate in AXE (chemistry fraternity) and
the undergraduate advisory board.
Laboratory Teaching Internships and Assistantships
Undergraduates have the opportunity to serve as laboratory teaching
assistants for entry-level undergraduate laboratory courses.
Special Topics
Special topics not offered through the normal course sequence may be
pursued through directed reading and registration in CHEM 396 with the
approval of the supervising faculty member, advisor, and vice chair for
undergraduate studies. An approved learning contract is required, and
students must be registered no later than the end of the first week of
classes.
Undergraduate Awards

Undergraduate Research
Almost every undergraduate chemistry major who has undertaken a
research project has found it to be an exciting and rewarding experience.
The reasons are many. One certainly is that it affords an opportunity
to make pioneering discoveries at the forefront of science, using
instrumentation and techniques far more sophisticated than those
usually encountered in standard laboratory courses.

More than 80 students are involved in undergraduate research
projects in chemistry each year. Although successful completion of
an undergraduate research project is a requirement for graduation
with honors or highest honors (see above), it is not necessary to be a
participant in Honors Carolina to undertake a research project.

The usual mechanism for becoming involved in a research project is
to register for CHEM 395. This process begins well in advance of a
preregistration or registration period with a visit to the Chemistry Student
Services office, where a student may obtain a list of undergraduate
research opportunities and a form titled Request for Registration in
CHEM 395.

Most students begin research during the spring semester of their junior
year and continue throughout their senior year. CHEM 395 and CHEM 396
together may be taken for credit as many times as desired but may be
counted for no more than nine hours total credit toward graduation in
either the B.A. or B.S. traditional and polymer tracks and for no more than
six hours in the B.S. biochemistry track. In the B.S. curriculum CHEM 395
may be counted no more than once as an advanced chemistry elective.
UNC–BEST
The UNC Baccalaureate Education in Science and Teaching (UNC–BEST)
Program is a collaboration between the School of Education and the
College of Arts and Sciences and is designed to allow undergraduate
science majors interested in teaching high school science the
opportunity to earn their science degree and obtain licensure as a North
Carolina high school science teacher in four years. UNC–BEST students
meet all the degree requirements for their chemistry degree using
CHEM 410 as one of their upper-level chemistry courses. UNC–BEST

302         Chemistry Major, B.S.–Biochemistry Track

students also fulfill teaching licensure coursework requirements as well
as many General Education and elective requirements as they complete
10 credit hours in teaching and learning, including EDUC 516 or EDUC 689
or EDUC 690, EDUC 532, and EDUC 615. During their final semester
students engage in a full-time student teaching internship (EDUC 593)
and participate in an education leadership seminar (EDUC 601). For

 Chemistry is the scientific study of the composition and properties of
matter and the investigation of the laws that govern them. All chemists
have a common core of knowledge, learned through a highly structured
sequence of undergraduate courses in which the content is divided
into the classical subdisciplines. Toward the end of students’ progress
through their four years of undergraduate study, they may choose to
concentrate in one or more areas of chemistry through the courses
selected to fulfill the chemistry elective requirements and through
undergraduate research.

laboratory course; for B.S. candidates they must all be lecture
courses.

• Have completed or be about to complete a research project certified
to be of publishable quality by the research advisor and two faculty
members appointed by the director of undergraduate studies

Honors in chemistry is a distinction bestowed on an outstanding student
who has demonstrated marked competence in the coursework and who
has completed a research project of considerable merit. To attain this
distinction the candidate must have nominally satisfied the following
guidelines:

• Have achieved a chemistry major grade point average of 3.40 or

higher

• Have received no grade below B- in junior- or senior-level chemistry

courses

• Have completed at least three lecture courses in chemistry numbered

CHEM 420 or above

• Have completed or be about to complete a research project certified

to be of honors quality by the research advisor and two faculty
members appointed by the vice chair for undergraduate studies

Students who wish to qualify for either of these awards should begin
planning their course programs and research activities in the junior year
so that ample time and effort may be devoted to succeeding in upper-
level courses and research.
Departmental Involvement
Majors are encouraged to participate in AXE (chemistry fraternity) and
the undergraduate advisory board.
Laboratory Teaching Internships and Assistantships
Undergraduates have the opportunity to serve as laboratory teaching
assistants for entry-level undergraduate laboratory courses.
Special Topics
Special topics not offered through the normal course sequence may be
pursued through directed reading and registration in CHEM 396 with the
approval of the supervising faculty member, advisor, and vice chair for
undergraduate studies. An approved learning contract is required, and
students must be registered no later than the end of the first week of
classes.
Undergraduate Awards
Excellent performances by undergraduates in chemistry are recognized
by the department through the following awards:

• Francis P. Venable Medal: A medallion and cash award are presented

to the two most outstanding graduating seniors majoring in
chemistry in honor of Dr. Francis P. Venable, who was chair of the
department, president of the University from 1900 to 1914, and
president of the American Chemical Society.

University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill            307

• Emmett Gladstone Rand Premedical Scholarship: A scholarship is

presented to an exceptionally talented graduating senior intending to
pursue a career in medicine.

• Jason D. Altom Memorial Award for Undergraduate Research: This

cash award recognizes research potential of an undergraduate
chemistry major.

• J. Thurman Freeze Scholarship: This scholarship serves to fund
summer research between a student’s junior and senior years.
• E.C. Markham Summer Research Fund: The department chair

selects the recipient of this award, who will use the salary to perform
research between the junior and senior years.

• Carrie Largent Award for Research Excellence: This award is given

annually to a graduating senior who has excelled in research.

• Tanya R. Ellison Scholarship: A female, junior or senior B.S. chemistry

major is selected for this cash award on the basis of character and
academic commitment.

• Hypercube Scholar Award: An outstanding senior majoring in

chemistry is given this chemical software package.

Undergraduate Research
Almost every undergraduate chemistry major who has undertaken a
research project has found it to be an exciting and rewarding experience.
The reasons are many. One certainly is that it affords an opportunity
to make pioneering discoveries at the forefront of science, using
instrumentation and techniques far more sophisticated than those
usually encountered in standard laboratory courses.

More than 80 students are involved in undergraduate research
projects in chemistry each year. Although successful completion of
an undergraduate research project is a requirement for graduation
with honors or highest honors (see above), it is not necessary to be a
participant in Honors Carolina to undertake a research project.

The usual mechanism for becoming involved in a research project is
to register for CHEM 395. This process begins well in advance of a
preregistration or registration period with a visit to the Chemistry Student
Services office, where a student may obtain a list of undergraduate
research opportunities and a form titled Request for Registration in
CHEM 395.

Most students begin research during the spring semester of their junior
year and continue throughout their senior year. CHEM 395 and CHEM 396
together may be taken for credit as many times as desired but may be
counted for no more than nine hours total credit toward graduation in
either the B.A. or B.S. traditional and polymer tracks and for no more than
six hours in the B.S. biochemistry track. In the B.S. curriculum CHEM 395
may be counted no more than once as an advanced chemistry elective.

Introduction

City and regional planning is an interdisciplinary field that seeks to
improve the quality of life for people in human settlements. Planners
are involved, for example, in forecasting what futures may hold for a
region, guiding the type and location of new development, analyzing
transportation systems, encouraging economic development, protecting
the environment, mediating diverse interests, and revitalizing urban
neighborhoods. They are involved in designing solutions to pressing
societal problems such as urban sprawl, unemployment, homelessness,
environmental pollution, and urban decay.

City and regional planners work for a variety of public and private
organizations. In the public sector local, state, and federal governments
all employ city and regional planners. In the private sector, planners work
for development companies, consulting firms, and a variety of nonprofit
organizations.

For undergraduates the Department of City and Regional Planning offers
basic coursework, opportunities for supervised practical experience,
and an academic minor. Undergraduate students take courses in the
department for several reasons: to learn about cities and planning
processes, to enrich or expand their current area of interest in different
aspects of urbanization, or to explore the possibility of graduate work
leading to a career in planning. Planning courses allow students to see
how the arts and sciences can be applied to improve the prosperity and
livability of cities, towns, and rural areas. In this way they help students
deepen their appreciation of their major field of study. Some planning
courses may fulfill General Education requirements.

Advising

The department’s director of dual-degree and undergraduate programs
serves as the primary point of contact for students participating in the
minor (see contact information above). Student advising and approval of
equivalent courses are handled through the director. Students also have
a primary academic advisor in Steele Building.

Facilities

The Department of City and Regional Planning is located in New East
Building on Cameron Avenue. An important resource available to the
department is the Center for Urban and Regional Studies, located in
Hickerson House, where the research and service programs of the
department are housed. The department has strong ties to the Institute
for the Environment. Other research centers that are of interest are

Introduction

Classics is the study of the ancient Greek and Roman world; the Greek
and Latin languages and literature; and the history, art, and culture
that have been fundamental in shaping modern society. A genuine
understanding of the past can be gained only through a wide-ranging
approach, encompassing words, thoughts, events, and objects. For this
reason, the field of classical studies is interdisciplinary in nature.

Advising

All majors and minors have a primary academic advisor in Steele
Building. Students are strongly encouraged to meet regularly with
their advisor and review their Tar Heel Tracker each semester. The
department’s director of undergraduate studies works with current
and prospective majors by appointments (see contact information
above). Departmental academic advising is particularly important for
those majors who are considering going on to graduate school. Further
information on courses, undergraduate research opportunities, the
honors program, careers, and graduate schools may be obtained from the
department’s Web site.

Graduate School and Career Opportunities

The undergraduate curriculum prepares students for specialized graduate
study in classical studies: classical philology, comparative literature,
archaeology (prehistoric, classical, and Byzantine), medieval studies,
philosophy, art history, ancient history, or linguistics. While many
graduating students go on to graduate programs in the humanities and
social sciences, others pursue careers in a range of fields, including law,
medicine, business, archaeology, and secondary education. Students
who wish to be certified to teach in public high schools should major in
Latin and then apply for admission to the M.A.T. program in the School
of Education. They also should discuss their plans with an adviser in the
School of Education no later than their junior year.

This concentration focuses on the material remains of prehistoric and
classical antiquity, while also providing a background in civilization,
history, and at least one classical language. The program of study is
designed to give students a basic knowledge of the art and architecture
of the Greeks and Romans and to introduce them to the use of
archaeology in the reconstruction of the past, including Egypt and
the ancient Near East. Majors in classical archaeology may not elect
a minor in the classical language that they use to satisfy their major
requirements, although they may elect a minor in the other classical
language. Students interested in majoring in classical archaeology
should consult the department as early as possible.

Special Opportunities in Classics
Honors in Classics
Classics majors wishing to take part in the departmental honors program
during their senior year must have a grade point average of at least 3.3
at the beginning of their senior year and maintain an average no lower
than this through their final semester in order to be eligible for honors
consideration.

The program consists of two courses, CLAS 691H and CLAS 692H,
taken sequentially in the fall and spring semesters. CLAS 691H involves
a directed reading in Greek, Latin, or archaeology in a general area
of the student’s interest and is conducted under the supervision
of a faculty member chosen by the student to serve as the honors
advisor. Requirements of the course include the preparation of a thesis
prospectus with accompanying bibliography and a preliminary oral
examination by the student’s thesis committee. A grade for CLAS 691H
is assigned on the basis of the total semester’s work. CLAS 692H entails
the writing of the thesis under the direction of the honors advisor and a
final oral defense before the candidate’s committee. This body, in turn,
reports its judgment to the department. If a degree with honors is to be
awarded, a recommendation for either honors or, for particular merit,
highest honors is made.
Additional Opportunities
The Department of Classics supports a number of activities, including
informal reading groups; the local chapter of Eta Sigma Phi, the national
undergraduate classics honorary society; and annual oral performances
and prize competitions in reciting and translating Greek and Latin

texts. Several of the prize competitions involve substantial cash
awards. Opportunities for undergraduate research include especially
the senior honors thesis and participation in archaeological fieldwork
as research assistants. The department encourages majors and minors
to take part in summer archaeological field projects; there are current
field projects directed or codirected by department faculty members
and associates at Azoria in Crete and at Huqoq and Omrit in Israel.
Other opportunities for study abroad include the programs of the
Intercollegiate Center for Classical Studies in Rome and the College
Year in Athens, and the exchange with King’s College London. A number
of departmental fellowships and other funding opportunities can
help support participation in archaeological field projects and other
research projects. Lastly, the Duke–UNC Consortium for Classical and
Mediterranean Archaeology provides archaeology students access to
coursework, seminars, excavations and other research opportunities,
academic advising, and avenues for curricular and extracurricular
interaction across both institutions. For further information about
prizes, fellowships, and opportunities for research and study abroad,
see the departmental Web site (http://classics.unc.edu/academics/

This concentration is designed to provide students with a broad, basic
knowledge of the classical world and with skills in analysis, written and
oral communication, and logical argument that will be applicable in any
profession. The civilization program is not designed to lead to graduate
work in classics, although students do sometimes go on in the field, and
it is often taken as part of a double major. Majors in classical civilization
may not elect a minor in the classical language that they use to satisfy
their major requirements, although they may elect a minor in the other
classical language. Students considering a major in classical civilization
should consult the department as soon as possible.

Special Opportunities in Classics
Honors in Classics
Classics majors wishing to take part in the departmental honors program
during their senior year must have a grade point average of at least 3.3
at the beginning of their senior year and maintain an average no lower
than this through their final semester in order to be eligible for honors
consideration.

The program consists of two courses, CLAS 691H and CLAS 692H,
taken sequentially in the fall and spring semesters. CLAS 691H involves
a directed reading in Greek, Latin, or archaeology in a general area
of the student’s interest and is conducted under the supervision
of a faculty member chosen by the student to serve as the honors
advisor. Requirements of the course include the preparation of a thesis
prospectus with accompanying bibliography and a preliminary oral
examination by the student’s thesis committee. A grade for CLAS 691H
is assigned on the basis of the total semester’s work. CLAS 692H entails
the writing of the thesis under the direction of the honors advisor and a
final oral defense before the candidate’s committee. This body, in turn,
reports its judgment to the department. If a degree with honors is to be
awarded, a recommendation for either honors or, for particular merit,
highest honors is made.
Additional Opportunities
The Department of Classics supports a number of activities, including
informal reading groups; the local chapter of Eta Sigma Phi, the national
undergraduate classics honorary society; and annual oral performances
and prize competitions in reciting and translating Greek and Latin
texts. Several of the prize competitions involve substantial cash
awards. Opportunities for undergraduate research include especially
the senior honors thesis and participation in archaeological fieldwork
as research assistants. The department encourages majors and minors
to take part in summer archaeological field projects; there are current
field projects directed or codirected by department faculty members
and associates at Azoria in Crete and at Huqoq and Omrit in Israel.
Other opportunities for study abroad include the programs of the
Intercollegiate Center for Classical Studies in Rome and the College
Year in Athens, and the exchange with King’s College London. A number
of departmental fellowships and other funding opportunities can
help support participation in archaeological field projects and other
research projects. Lastly, the Duke–UNC Consortium for Classical and
Mediterranean Archaeology provides archaeology students access to
coursework, seminars, excavations and other research opportunities,
academic advising, and avenues for curricular and extracurricular
interaction across both institutions. For further information about
prizes, fellowships, and opportunities for research and study abroad,

see the departmental Web site (http://classics.unc.edu/academics/

Classics Major, B.A.–Greek

The goal of the concentration in Greek is the development of a basic
command of the language and a solid knowledge of the literature, history,
and culture of the Greeks. Students interested in an undergraduate major
in Greek or in a combined major in Greek and Latin should consult the
department by the second semester of the sophomore year. For Greek as
satisfying the language requirement for the B.A. degree, see the General
Education section in this catalog.

Classics Major, B.A.–Latin

The goal of the concentration in Latin is the development of a basic
command of the language and a solid knowledge of the literature, history,
and culture of the Romans. Students interested in an undergraduate
major in Latin or a combined major in Latin and Greek should consult the
department by the second semester of the sophomore year. For Latin as
satisfying the language requirement for the B.A. degree, see the General
Education section in this catalog.

Classics Major, B.A.–Combined Greek and
Latin

This is not a double major, but a concentration designed to develop
facility in both ancient languages and in the literatures of both Greece
and Rome. This program is recommended for students who have a strong
interest in continuing classical languages at the graduate level. In this
major students emphasize one language yet acquire facility in the other.

Introduction

The study of communication is essential for participating in an
increasingly complex and mediated global environment. Through its
teaching, research, and service, the Department of Communication
addresses the many ways communication functions to create, sustain,
and transform personal life, social relations, political institutions,
economic organizations, and cultural and aesthetic conventions in
society; promotes competencies required for various modes of mediated
and nonmediated communication; and develops skills for analyzing,
interpreting, and critiquing communication problems and questions.

The programs of study offered by the department thus provide a firm
foundation for enriched personal living, for professional effectiveness
regardless of the specific career one may pursue, and for informed
participation in the human community.

Advising

Department advising for the major in communication studies is
conducted by

1. a full-time lecturer/advisor who holds office hours in Swain Hall and

Steele Building (see the department’s Web site for the advisor’s office
and office hours),

2. the director of undergraduate studies for the Department of

Communication (see the department’s Web site for the director’s
office and office hours), and

3. representative faculty members.

Facilities

The department has extensive media production and performance
studies facilities located in Swain Hall and Bingham Hall. Swain Hall
is home to state-of-the-art media production equipment, classroom
space, and editing suites. It also houses Studio 6, where numerous live
performances are staged. Bingham Hall contains the Martha Nell Hardy
Performance Space.

Graduate School and Career Opportunities

Upon completion of their degrees, students are prepared for graduate
study and research in communication. Advanced study may be pursued
in a problem-defined approach to communication research. A substantial
number of graduate assistantships allow M.A.-through-Ph.D. and Ph.D.-
only candidates to gain experience in research, teaching, production, and
administration. Graduate study is characterized by intensive participation
in seminars, original research and creative activities, and close work with

University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill            329

individual faculty members. Students are also prepared for advanced
study in related academic disciplines such as law.

The career outlook for students with degrees in communication studies
is promising, and graduates enter a variety of professions that value
communication knowledge and skills. Communication studies majors are
prepared to serve as communication specialists in business; in federal,
state, and local governments and agencies; and in public service. Some
of the specific areas in which majors pursue careers are teaching, social
advocacy, public relations and advertising, personnel management and
training, management consulting, video and film production, and work
with emerging technologies.

An understanding of communication provides a strong base for a range
of career options. The mission of the department is to go beyond narrow
technical training by providing a liberal arts approach to communication.
This provides the student with maximum latitude for promotion and
advancement and avoids limited career opportunities resulting from
narrow approaches to the field.

The burgeoning growth of communication industries and support fields
provides a range of career opportunities. Graduates of the department,
who number well over 4,000, are engaged in a variety of occupations
ranging from work for international corporations to jobs at local nonprofit
organizations.

The cultural studies program is designed to give students the opportunity
to create a rigorous, interdisciplinary/multidisciplinary program organized
around a particular theme, question, problem, or interest (e.g., third world/
ethnic studies, technology, science studies, theory, neoliberalism, labor,
disability, popular culture, etc.), or to establish links across a range of
classes that define a specific intellectual focus. Cultural studies offers a
home to students united by questions of the complex, dynamic workings
of culture in contexts of power.

The major is designed for undergraduate students who wish to combine
the strengths of various departments and curricula in the College of
Arts and Sciences. Students in the cultural studies program tend to
be strongly motivated, self-disciplined, intellectually curious, and able
to assume greater responsibility for their education. The program is

University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill            343

distinguished by intensive advising, collaboration across disciplinary
perspectives, and opportunities to extend learning beyond the space of
the classroom. Students interested in cultural studies should meet with
one of the directors of the program to explore their interests and choose
an advisor.

Introduction

The Department of Computer Science offers instruction and performs
research in the essential areas of computer science. Majors receive
rigorous training in the foundations of computer science and the relevant
mathematics, then have ample opportunity to specialize in advanced
courses.

Majors can receive credit for practical training as a computing
professional through an internship with a company or organization in the
computing or information technology fields. Internships typically are paid
positions and involve the student working off campus. All internships
for credit must be approved in advance by the director of undergraduate
studies. Students interested in pursuing such an internship should
contact the director of undergraduate studies prior to the start of the
internship.

Majors who excel in the program also have the opportunity to perform
undergraduate research in computer science. Research projects may be
pursued in conjunction with an existing graduate research group in the
department and/or may be used as a vehicle for graduating with honors
as described below.

Students with no prior programming experience should consider taking
one of the introductory courses, COMP 110 or COMP 116. COMP 101
is intended for students who wish to develop a better understanding of
computers in a context that does not involve programming. Students
with prior programming experience should begin their studies with
COMP 401. COMP 380 and COMP 388 are philosophical and moral
reasoning Approaches courses that have no programming prerequisite.

Advising

In addition to general advising through the Academic Advising Program,
students can consult designated faculty members within the Department
of Computer Science who act as departmental advisors for requirements
specific to the major or minor. Beyond course selection, advisors are
also available for discussing internships, study abroad in computer
science, honors projects, and undergraduate research opportunities. See
the department Web site (http://www.cs.unc.edu) for a list of current
department advisors.

H Honors version available. An honors course fulfills the same

requirements as the nonhonors version of that course. Enrollment
and GPA restrictions may apply.

Notes on the Suggested Plan of Study
A first formal course in computer programming (such as COMP 110) is
a prerequisite for COMP 401. Students with no programming experience
should begin their program of study with COMP 110. Students who
are unsure if their background preparation enables them to begin their
studies with COMP 401 are encouraged to consult a departmental
advisor.

Students who are able to begin with COMP 401 may take it in their first
semester and either advance the suggested program of study by one
semester (giving themselves an extra free elective in their junior/senior
years) or take another appropriate course such as a first-year seminar.
In either case, neither COMP 110 nor a first-year seminar is a required
course in the major.

This plan of study further assumes that students will place out of foreign
language 1. If this is not the case, then the student should start with
foreign language 1 (and have one fewer free elective in the senior year).

Special Opportunities in Computer
Science
Honors in Computer Science
Students are eligible for graduation with honors if they complete the
following requirements:

• A cumulative grade point average of 3.3 or better
• A grade point average of 3.3 or better from among the set of COMP,

MATH, PHYS, and STOR courses taken to fulfill the graduation
requirements for the major

• Graduation with honors requires the completion of two semesters
of research (COMP 691H and COMP 692H). As part of COMP 692H,
students must submit a written honors thesis and complete an
oral public presentation of the thesis. Graduation with highest
honors in computer science is possible for those students whose
honors project and thesis are judged by a faculty committee to be
particularly distinguished.

Students interested in pursuing honors in computer science are
encouraged to contact the director of undergraduate studies.
Experiential Education
When arranged in advance with a supervising faculty member, COMP 293
can be used to earn credit for appropriate work experience in the
summer. COMP 293 satisfies the experiential education requirement.

University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill            353

COMP 495 and COMP 691H can also be used to satisfy the experiential
education requirement. Another possibility is through study abroad (see
below).
Assistantships and Internships
In addition to their classroom experiences, undergraduates may enhance
their learning experience as research assistants or teaching assistants.
Students also can participate in nationally recognized research programs
or use the department's facilities to pursue self-directed research with a
faculty member.

Work-study students can gain valuable work experience as assistants
on the department’s computer services staff. The department also
encourages students to pursue internship experiences. Carolina’s
proximity to Research Triangle Park means that computer science majors
have many internship and postgraduation opportunities available in their
own backyard.
Study Abroad
Study abroad opportunities with priority for computer science students
are offered through University College London (UCL) and the National
University of Singapore (NUS) School of Computing.

UCL can accept UNC–Chapel Hill students for either a semester or
yearlong exchange. For semester-only programs, UCL recommends
registering for spring semester rather than fall as it better matches their
academic calendar. Many courses satisfying the computer science B.S.
requirements can be completed at UCL. UCL is located in the heart of
London and is just a few blocks away from UNC–Chapel Hill’s European
Study Center in Winston House.

NUS can accept UNC–Chapel Hill students for fall or spring semester, or
a yearlong exchange. This exchange allows Carolina students to enroll
directly into the NUS School of Computing and choose their courses from
among the full offering. On a case-by-case basis, students may also be
able to take other courses at NUS outside of the School of Computing.
Study abroad at NUS is eligible for the Phillips Ambassadors Scholarship.
Please see phillips.unc.edu (http://phillips.unc.edu) for more information.

Specific course equivalences for both schools are posted on the
department’s Web site. Students interested in taking a course not listed
should contact the director of undergraduate studies before registering
for courses at the school.

Application for both programs is through the University’s Study Abroad
Office. Application to the UCL programs and the NUS fall and yearlong
programs takes place early in the spring of each year. Application for the
NUS spring program takes place early in the fall of each year. Applicants
for exchange participation must have completed at least one year of
study at UNC–Chapel Hill and must have declared a computer science
or precomputer science major. Study abroad satisfies the experiential
education General Education requirement of the undergraduate
curriculum.
Undergraduate Awards
The department awards two yearly prizes to computer science majors.
In conjunction with SAS Institute, the department annually presents
the Charles H. Dunham Scholarship. The Dunham scholarship includes
a cash award to the student and a summer internship at SAS and is
awarded in the spring semester to a student in their junior year. The
department also annually presents the Stephen F. Weiss Award for
Outstanding Achievement in Computer Science, which includes a cash

354         Computer Science Major, B.S.

prize. The Weiss award is presented to a student in the fall of the senior
year.

A first formal course in computer programming (such as COMP 110) is
a prerequisite for COMP 401. Students with no programming experience
should begin their program of study with COMP 110. Students who
are unsure if their background preparation enables them to begin their
studies with COMP 401 are encouraged to consult a departmental
advisor.

Students who are able to begin with COMP 401 may take it in their first
semester and either advance the suggested program of study by one
semester (giving themselves an extra free elective in their junior/senior
years) or take another appropriate course such as a first-year seminar.
In either case, neither COMP 110 nor a first-year seminar is a required
course in the major.

This plan of study further assumes that students will place out of foreign
language 1. If this is not the case, then the student should start with
foreign language 1 (and have one fewer free elective in the senior year).

Special Opportunities in Computer
Science
Honors in Computer Science
Students are eligible for graduation with honors if they complete the
following requirements:

• A cumulative grade point average of 3.3 or better
• A grade point average of 3.3 or better from among the set of COMP,

MATH, PHYS, and STOR courses taken to fulfill the graduation
requirements for the major

• Graduation with honors requires the completion of two semesters
of research (COMP 691H and COMP 692H). As part of COMP 692H,
students must submit a written honors thesis and complete an
oral public presentation of the thesis. Graduation with highest
honors in computer science is possible for those students whose
honors project and thesis are judged by a faculty committee to be
particularly distinguished.

Students interested in pursuing honors in computer science are
encouraged to contact the director of undergraduate studies.
Experiential Education
When arranged in advance with a supervising faculty member, COMP 293
can be used to earn credit for appropriate work experience in the
summer. COMP 293 satisfies the experiential education requirement.
COMP 495 and COMP 691H can also be used to satisfy the experiential
education requirement. Another possibility is through study abroad (see
below).
Assistantships and Internships
In addition to their classroom experiences, undergraduates may enhance
their learning experience as research assistants or teaching assistants.

356         Computer Science Minor

Students also can participate in nationally recognized research programs
or use the department's facilities to pursue self-directed research with a
faculty member.

Work-study students can gain valuable work experience as assistants
on the department’s computer services staff. The department also
encourages students to pursue internship experiences. Carolina’s
proximity to Research Triangle Park means that computer science majors
have many internship and postgraduation opportunities available in their
own backyard.
Study Abroad
Study abroad opportunities with priority for computer science students
are offered through University College London (UCL) and the National
University of Singapore (NUS) School of Computing.

UCL can accept UNC–Chapel Hill students for either a semester or
yearlong exchange. For semester-only programs, UCL recommends
registering for spring semester rather than fall as it better matches their
academic calendar. Many courses satisfying the computer science B.S.
requirements can be completed at UCL. UCL is located in the heart of
London and is just a few blocks away from UNC–Chapel Hill’s European
Study Center in Winston House.

NUS can accept UNC–Chapel Hill students for fall or spring semester, or
a yearlong exchange. This exchange allows Carolina students to enroll
directly into the NUS School of Computing and choose their courses from
among the full offering. On a case-by-case basis, students may also be
able to take other courses at NUS outside of the School of Computing.
Study abroad at NUS is eligible for the Phillips Ambassadors Scholarship.
Please see phillips.unc.edu (http://phillips.unc.edu) for more information.

Specific course equivalences for both schools are posted on the
department’s Web site. Students interested in taking a course not listed
should contact the director of undergraduate studies before registering
for courses at the school.

Application for both programs is through the University’s Study Abroad
Office. Application to the UCL programs and the NUS fall and yearlong
programs takes place early in the spring of each year. Application for the
NUS spring program takes place early in the fall of each year. Applicants
for exchange participation must have completed at least one year of
study at UNC–Chapel Hill and must have declared a computer science
or precomputer science major. Study abroad satisfies the experiential
education General Education requirement of the undergraduate
curriculum.
Undergraduate Awards
The department awards two yearly prizes to computer science majors.
In conjunction with SAS Institute, the department annually presents
the Charles H. Dunham Scholarship. The Dunham scholarship includes
a cash award to the student and a summer internship at SAS and is
awarded in the spring semester to a student in their junior year. The
department also annually presents the Stephen F. Weiss Award for
Outstanding Achievement in Computer Science, which includes a cash
prize. The Weiss award is presented to a student in the fall of the senior
year.

Dual Bachelor’s–Master’s Degree Program

Students in the B.S. degree program with a GPA of 3.2 or better after five
or more semesters of study have the option of applying to the dual B.S.–
M.S. program at UNC–Chapel Hill to pursue graduate coursework leading

to the degree of master of science. Such students must complete the
requirements for the bachelor of science degree within eight semesters.
Upon completion of the B.S. degree, students then enroll as a graduate
student to continue work towards the master of science degree.

The requirements for the master of science degree can be found in the
Graduate Catalog. Generally, the master’s degree requires 30 additional
hours of computer science coursework. Up to nine credit hours of
computer science coursework taken while an undergraduate can be
applied to the master’s degree if the coursework is not also used to
satisfy the graduation requirements for the bachelor’s degree. The
requirements for the master’s can be completed in as few as two
additional semesters, for a total of 10 semesters of study.

Students interested in the dual-degree program should have completed
(or be on track to complete) seven computer science courses at the
400 level or higher by the end of their sixth semester. Students must
formally apply for admission to the combined B.S.–M.S. program, and it
is expected that the application process would take place in the student’s
sixth semester. Students applying in their sixth semester of study will
be notified of the outcome of their application by the end of their sixth
semester.

Students interested in the dual-degree program are strongly advised
to consult the director of undergraduate studies in the Department of
Computer Science in their sophomore year to discuss eligibility and an
appropriate plan of study.

The study of dramatic art focuses upon the great dramatic texts of the
classical and modern periods and introduces the student to the variety of
artistic endeavors necessary to realize the text in theatrical performance.
Majors concentrate on the literature and history of the theatre while
investigating the processes involved in acting, directing, design, costume,
and technical production.

Courses focus on the connections between theatre and society, between
theatrical performance and the visual arts, and between dramatic
literature and philosophy, history, and other literary forms. The study of
theatre embraces a range of subjects in the humanities and fine arts,
including literature, language, aesthetics, culture, and performance.

Special Opportunities in Dramatic Art
Honors in Dramatic Art
In order to receive departmental honors, students must have a 3.3 overall
grade point average, a 3.6 grade point average in dramatic art, and
complete at least five of the eight core courses in the major by the end
of the junior year. Students enroll in DRAM 691H (three hours credit) and
DRAM 692H (three hours credit) during their senior year and complete a
special project (essay or creative endeavor) approved by the department.
A student may then be designated as a candidate for undergraduate
honors or highest honors based on department review of the special
project or performance.
Departmental Involvement
Two undergraduate students are elected each year from among the
majors to serve as representatives to the faculty. They attend faculty
meetings and host events that bring students and faculty together.
Performance/Production Opportunities
The Department of Dramatic Art’s Kenan Theatre Company (KTC), offers
many opportunities for interested students—majors and nonmajors
alike—to participate in performance and production. Each year the
department supports four to six full productions in the Elizabeth Price
Kenan Theatre. Seasons may include classic plays, contemporary plays,
musicals, and original works. A faculty and peer-elected board of five
undergraduate students acts as producing director for KTC and oversees
the department season. Productions are directed by faculty and guest
artists as well as by students. Undergraduate students are involved in the
technical components of production as designers, carpenters, painters,
electricians, seamstresses, and sound engineers. The KTC producers
select an undergraduate prop supervisor, wardrobe supervisor, master
electrician, master carpenter, and a technical director for the entire
season. Designers are selected on a per show basis and can include
undergraduates, graduate students, and faculty members.
PlayMakers Repertory Company
Several types of student involvement with PlayMakers Repertory
Company (PRC, a professional LORT/AEA theatre on campus)
are possible. Technical assistance, running crews, internships in
administration, and assistant stage management positions are open
to undergraduates. Auditions are held during the year for appropriate
supporting and understudy roles. PRC engages resident and guest
professionals active in regional and commercial theatres as guest actors,
directors, and designers. Students have opportunities to associate with
and learn from these professionals throughout the year.
Study Abroad
With more than 300 programs available in 70 countries, there are
many international experiences structured to enhance the student’s
undergraduate career. Major and minor credit is available as well as
General Education credit. Departmental approval for theatre courses is
arranged with the director of undergraduate studies and is coordinated by
the Study Abroad Office.

Specific study abroad opportunities for dramatic art students include,
but are not limited to, semester or yearlong exchange programs at Trinity

Students are also eligible for the Elizabeth Malone Roughton Study
Abroad Scholarship, a scholarship awarded to a dramatic art student
studying in Ireland for a semester and completing a theatre-related
internship as part of the program.
Undergraduate Awards
Each spring the Department of Dramatic Art awards several monetary
prizes to its undergraduate majors (and graduate students) who are
continuing into the next academic year. The prizes have been endowed
by generous alumni and friends, including Andy Griffith and George
Grizzard. In addition, the Sam Selden Prize in Playwriting, the Wes
Egan Award in Design, and the Lillian Chason Scholarship are awarded
competitively each year.
Undergraduate Research
Faculty and departmental advisors are available to help students define
areas of interest, understand the existing knowledge base in a particular
area, and develop a plan for meaningful undergraduate research. These
goals can be realized through departmental independent study and
honors research. See the director of undergraduate studies and the
honors advisor for more information. Additional resources are available

Introduction

Economics is commonly defined as the study of how society allocates
scarce resources to satisfy unlimited wants. It focuses upon the fact that
we wish to maximize our satisfaction through the consumption of goods
and services (including leisure time); however, the resources available for
production are limited. Hence, decisions must be made regarding what
to produce, how to produce it most efficiently, and how to distribute the
output among the various members of the society. Economics analyzes
the market framework for making such choices.

At the microeconomic or “individual unit” level, economics examines the
behavior of consumers, business firms, workers, and individual markets.
At the macroeconomic or “aggregate” level, attention is given to the
national and international problems of unemployment, inflation, balance
of payments, and economic growth.

The courses leading to a B.A. degree with a major in economics comprise
a large area of inquiry into the problems and structure of the economic
segment of society. The curriculum provides the opportunity to achieve
one or more of the following objectives:

University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill            369

graduate school. Further information on courses, undergraduate research
opportunities, the honors program, careers, and graduate schools may be
obtained from the department’s Web site.

Graduate School and Career Opportunities

Economics students in recent years have frequently pursued graduate
work in law and business administration, as well as the Ph.D. degree
in economics. Others have entered international affairs/international
studies programs. Students planning to pursue graduate work in
economics should continue to take mathematics courses beyond
the required level, and a minor or second major in mathematics is
recommended.

Most students have accepted employment with commercial and
investment banks, accounting and insurance firms, and a variety of other
corporations. The economics major competes well with other majors
(including business administration) in the job market. Employment

A grade of C must be attained in at least six of the seven major courses
numbered above 101. For majors in the department’s honors program,
the minimum is eight economics courses rather than seven courses
in addition to ECON 101. The same provisions apply, except that
ECON 691H and ECON 692H must constitute two of the eight courses.

Note: STOR 113 is recommended for most economics majors. MATH 231
is recommended for students who plan to take the calculus sequence
(MATH 231, MATH 232, and MATH 233). MATH 116 is not acceptable.

An economics major may apply as many as 15 economics courses, or
45 hours, toward the B.A. degree. ECON 101 will satisfy the social and
behavioral sciences Approaches requirement, and the calculus course
will satisfy the quantitative reasoning Foundations requirement. Both
ECON 400 and ECON 570 satisfy the quantitative intensive Connections
requirement.

Economics (ECON) course decriptions (p. 370).

Economics Major, NUS Joint Degree

UNC–Chapel Hill undergraduates can spend between two and four
semesters at the National University of Singapore (NUS) and receive
a joint bachelor of arts degree with a major in economics from both
institutions. Qualified UNC–Chapel Hill students will have at least a 3.3
grade point average and can apply for the joint degree beginning in the
second semester of their first year until the second semester of their
junior year. UNC joint-degree students can decide how many semesters
(between two and four) and at which point in their undergraduate career
they would like to study at NUS, as long as it is after their first year at
Carolina.

A minimum of 120 credit hours is required for graduation. They
consist of a total of 60 hours in the major (including as many as six
to 12 hours of honors work if applicable) and 45 hours of General
Education requirements. The remaining 15 hours consist of electives, the
Supplemental General Education requirement, and possibly one minor.
All General Education and graduation requirements of both UNC–Chapel
Hill and NUS must be met. A detailed listing of the requirements for both
schools and how to satisfy those requirements is available at the UNC
Study Abroad Office.

Special Opportunities in Economics
Honors in Economics
The Department of Economics honors program offers outstanding
economics students the opportunity to work closely with an individual
faculty member on a specialized research topic of the student’s choice
during the senior year. Generally, students with a 3.5 grade point average
in economics courses and 3.3 in all University coursework may be invited
to participate in this two-course program (ECON 691H and ECON 692H).

In the first semester (ECON 691H), students become familiar with
the recent literature on topics of major interest. Each candidate
formulates an honors thesis proposal and initiates work on the project.
In ECON 692H, the thesis work is conducted under the supervision of
a faculty advisor who is a specialist in the general topic area of the
research.

Near the end of the second semester (ECON 692H), the student stands
for an oral examination on the thesis. Upon successful completion of the
program, the student receives the bachelor of arts degree with honors or
with highest honors. Students in the honors program are also required to
complete at least an eight-course major rather than the minimum seven
courses, including ECON 691H and ECON 692H.
Departmental Involvement
Undergraduates in economics have organized an active club, the Carolina
Economics Club. Seminars, social activities, and greater interaction
among students and with faculty have resulted from the formation of
this on-going organization. The Club also has helped the Department
of Economics conduct an annual job fair. All majors are invited to
participate in this organization’s activities. In addition, the local chapter
of Omicron Delta Epsilon, the national economics honor society, annually
extends membership to those outstanding junior and senior economics
majors who have demonstrated strong academic performance both
overall and in their economics courses.
Undergraduate Awards
Each spring the Chancellor awards the Undergraduate Prize in Economics
to the undergraduate student majoring in economics who has been
judged the most outstanding on the basis of major and related course
performances.

This minor is designed for students who wish to remain in another
discipline but who have an interest in the process of entrepreneurship.
Entrepreneurship is the mechanism by which new products, services, and
organizational processes are identified, refined, and ultimately realized
as a sustainable part of the society. There is a common process for
realizing all types of ventures. The minor will provide the student with the
background to undertake entrepreneurial activity in either the business or
social realm. The venture workshop course requirement allows students
to select an area of focus, including commercial, scientific, social, arts,
sport, public health, and social ventures. An internship opportunity is a
key component of the minor.

Introduction

The Department of English and Comparative Literature is a vibrant and
diverse department with a global reach. Our course offerings present
a diversity of approaches to the study, production, and appreciation of
literary and nonliterary texts. In our undergraduate program, we pursue a
four-fold mission to

evaluate, and promote, in clear and forceful language, new ideas as well
as civilizing influences of a shared past or an increasingly global present.

Advising

Because the major in comparative literature is a relatively small major,
students and faculty members have the opportunity for frequent
discussions. Majors should expect to work closely with the director
of undergraduate studies and other faculty members in comparative
literature to design and follow a coherent and cohesive plan of study in
the major, as well as to consider options for independent research, study
abroad, and honors thesis opportunities. Students are expected to review
their Tar Heel Tracker each semester and work with advisors in Steele
Building to ensure timely progress towards the degree.

All English majors have a primary academic advisor in Steele Building.
Students are strongly encouraged to meet regularly with their advisor and
review their Tar Heel Tracker each semester. The department’s director
of undergraduate studies works with current and prospective majors by
appointment. Departmental academic advising is particularly important
for those majors who are considering going on to graduate school.
Further information on courses, undergraduate research opportunities,
the honors program, careers, and graduate schools may be obtained from
the department’s Web site.

Graduate School and Career Opportunities

Majors in English and comparative literature provide essential
preparation for numerous career paths in business and government
as well as in education, the law, and medicine. These professions seek
leaders who value breadth of information; the capacity to comprehend
complex situations from multiple perspectives; and readiness to describe,

To major in comparative literature is to explore major works of literature,
film, and theory from across the world, crossing disciplinary as well as
national, cultural, and linguistic boundaries. Majoring in comparative
literature enables students to acquire a broad, liberal arts-based
education and equips them to live, work, and communicate in a
multicultural world.

Additional Information for Both Comparative Literature
Concentrations
Students may choose comparative literature as a second major, a
particularly attractive option for those majoring in a foreign language
because up to four of the foreign language major requirements can also
count toward the 10-course major requirement in comparative literature.

Undergraduates majoring in comparative literature may minor in any
department, curriculum, or school in which a minor is offered.

Majors should expect to work closely with the undergraduate advisor to
design and follow a coherent, cohesive plan of study. Students who study
abroad can generally apply their literature credits towards the major.
Students completing the global cinema studies track may not complete a
minor in global cinema studies.

All majors, regardless of their chosen track, must obtain at least a level
4 proficiency in a foreign language relevant to their individual area of
interest. We strongly recommend that students in the global cinema
studies track study as many film courses in the original languages as
possible.

Sophomores planning to major in comparative literature should take
one course under the Great Books I rubric, which treats ancient and
premodern literatures, and one course under the Great Books II rubric,
which treats literature from 1750 to the present. One of these courses
can be used to fulfill the General Education literary arts Approaches
requirement.

Special Opportunities in English and
Comparative Literature
Honors in Comparative Literature
Majors with an overall 3.3 grade point average may elect to write an
honors thesis by applying for permission to the director of undergraduate
studies in the spring semester of their junior year. Students then register
for CMPL 691H and CMPL 692H during their senior year. These courses
may count as credit towards completion of the major. Students write
the 50- to 70-page thesis on a comparative topic under the direction
of any faculty member. The student conducts independent research
during the summer between junior and senior years, often with the
assistance of research funding. The first semester of the senior year
involves regular tutorial sessions with the faculty advisor, as well as the
completion of most of the writing of the thesis. In the spring students
finish the process of writing and defend the completed thesis at an
oral examination. For more information about the honors thesis in
comparative literature, including examples of past thesis topics, please
visit the English and Comparative Literature Honors Thesis Web site
(http://englishcomplit.unc.edu/complit/undergraduate/honors_thesis).
Honors in Creative Writing
See “Creative Writing Minor (p. 414)."
Honors in English
The Department offers at least two English honors seminars each
semester. In addition, students seeking a degree with honors in English
(a 3.3 cumulative grade point average and a 3.6 grade point average in
major courses required) undertake a yearlong independent project during

their senior year (ENGL 691H and ENGL 692H) and usually produce a
40- to 50-page thesis. Students pursuing a degree with honors normally
meet every week with the professors supervising their projects. This
opportunity for individually directed research and writing often proves to
be a high point of the student’s academic career.
Study Abroad
Some of the best programs offered at the University for study overseas
are especially appropriate and useful to majors in the Department of
English and Comparative Literature. These include semester or yearlong
programs at Bristol, Manchester, Sussex, Edinburgh, Glasgow, and certain
Australian universities. Students who have a minimum grade point
average of 3.3 at the end of their sophomore year can participate in the
King’s College Exchange Program at King’s College, London (representing
either English or comparative literature). Special opportunities are also
available at Oxford University and through the Joint Degree Program
with the National University of Singapore. Comparative literature
students most frequently travel to non-English-speaking destinations. For
information on all overseas programs, see the Study Abroad Office or visit
their Web site (http://studyabroad.unc.edu).

The major in English equips students to become incisive thinkers
and powerful writers. At UNC, English majors develop these skills by
learning to analyze a range of literary genres and cultural artifacts: from
broadsides and books to digital archives and mp3s; from poetry and the
novel to dramatic performance and film. The B.A. with a major in English
foregrounds the inventive ways that individuals from various historical
and cultural settings have engaged writing and artistic representation to
understand—and remake—the world around them.

The core curriculum of the English major offers students a
comprehensive overview of the history of English-language literature and
thought, from their beginnings in the Middle Ages to the contemporary
rise of English as a global language. The core also features introductory
courses, which impart analytical, research, and writing skills that help
students explore the relevance of literature and other media to questions
of history, culture, and everyday life.

The B.A. launches English majors into a digital, global world with
historical knowledge about what has shaped it. Because rigorous
analysis of literary documents requires sensitivity to the context of
their production, students who major in English enter this increasingly
technological and transnational world with a crucial skill: the ability to
think contextually. In learning to describe and analyze relations between
an individual work and its social, cultural, and political environment,
our students are equipped for the world outside of the university with
the tools for solving a host of intellectual problems—medical, legal,
technological, and beyond.

Elective Courses
Students may choose elective courses numbered between ENGL 200
and ENGL 699 (which may include any of the courses listed among the
core requirements). Students have the option to group these electives
within a concentrated area of study called a “pathway.” Pathways are not
required, but choosing (or creating) one can help focus studies (e.g., in
order to prepare for graduate school or to develop an area of interest to
pursue later as a profession). Students may create their own pathway or
choose one of the following pre-selected pathways:

• Transnational literature
• Writing, editing, publishing
• Archives to digital humanities: 21st century research methods
• English and education
• Gender and sexuality
• Music, the visual arts, and media studies

University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill            411

• Literature and social justice
• Literature, war, and empire
• Race and ethnicity studies
• Science, medicine, and literature
• Theory and philosophy

English majors may choose additional courses, though they should
keep in mind that no more than 45 semester hours of English (excluding
ENGL 100 and ENGL 105/ENGL 105I) may be used toward the B.A.
graduation requirement.

Students must have a grade of C or better in at least 18 semester
hours in courses numbered ENGL 120 and above to satisfy the major
requirements. All General Education requirements apply.

English (ENGL) course descriptions (p. 379).

English Major, NUS Joint Degree

English majors may wish to consider applying for the Joint Degree
Program, an innovative joint undergraduate degree program between the
University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and the National University of
Singapore. UNC–Chapel Hill undergraduates spend anywhere from two to
four semesters at the National University of Singapore and receive a joint
bachelor of arts degree from both institutions. For further information,
contact the Study Abroad Office.

English Majors in the School of Education

A student interested in teaching English in public high schools can apply
to the M.A.T. program for certification after completing a B.A. in English.
To meet certification requirements, students should take the following
courses as part of, or in addition to, the English major (remaining within
the 45-hour limit referenced above):

Three required courses:
ENGL 313
ENGL 368

or ENGL 369

Special Opportunities in English and
Comparative Literature
Honors in Comparative Literature
Majors with an overall 3.3 grade point average may elect to write an
honors thesis by applying for permission to the director of undergraduate
studies in the spring semester of their junior year. Students then register
for CMPL 691H and CMPL 692H during their senior year. These courses
may count as credit towards completion of the major. Students write

412         Comparative Literature Minor

the 50- to 70-page thesis on a comparative topic under the direction
of any faculty member. The student conducts independent research
during the summer between junior and senior years, often with the
assistance of research funding. The first semester of the senior year
involves regular tutorial sessions with the faculty advisor, as well as the
completion of most of the writing of the thesis. In the spring students
finish the process of writing and defend the completed thesis at an
oral examination. For more information about the honors thesis in
comparative literature, including examples of past thesis topics, please
visit the English and Comparative Literature Honors Thesis Web site
(http://englishcomplit.unc.edu/complit/undergraduate/honors_thesis).
Honors in Creative Writing
See “Creative Writing Minor (p. 414)."
Honors in English
The Department offers at least two English honors seminars each
semester. In addition, students seeking a degree with honors in English
(a 3.3 cumulative grade point average and a 3.6 grade point average in
major courses required) undertake a yearlong independent project during
their senior year (ENGL 691H and ENGL 692H) and usually produce a
40- to 50-page thesis. Students pursuing a degree with honors normally
meet every week with the professors supervising their projects. This
opportunity for individually directed research and writing often proves to
be a high point of the student’s academic career.
Study Abroad
Some of the best programs offered at the University for study overseas
are especially appropriate and useful to majors in the Department of
English and Comparative Literature. These include semester or yearlong
programs at Bristol, Manchester, Sussex, Edinburgh, Glasgow, and certain
Australian universities. Students who have a minimum grade point
average of 3.3 at the end of their sophomore year can participate in the
King’s College Exchange Program at King’s College, London (representing
either English or comparative literature). Special opportunities are also
available at Oxford University and through the Joint Degree Program
with the National University of Singapore. Comparative literature
students most frequently travel to non-English-speaking destinations. For
information on all overseas programs, see the Study Abroad Office or visit
their Web site (http://studyabroad.unc.edu).

For more information, please consult the degree requirements section of
the catalog (p. 92).

The Creative Writing Program offers a minor in creative writing. The minor
requires 15 hours, a total of five courses, and may be earned in one of two
ways:

1. by completing introductory, intermediate, advanced, and two-

semester senior honors classes in one genre; or

2. by completing five courses in any combination of genres.

Students need to begin work toward the minor at least by their
sophomore year and may take one creative writing class per semester.
Enrollment in courses beyond the introductory level is by permission only.
Students must seek permission from the program’s director to declare
the minor once they have taken two creative writing courses and are on
track to graduate. Completion of a minor in creative writing is contingent
on the student’s successful advancement through the sequence.

The Creative Writing Program also gives credit toward the minor for
several courses offered in other departments, such as DRAM 231,
COMM 330, COMM 433, and MEJO 256. To qualify for a degree with
honors or highest honors in creative writing, students must maintain
a 3.3 grade point average and meet all requirements both to enter and
to complete the senior honors seminar (ENGL 693H and ENGL 694H).
Students minoring in creative writing and planning to study abroad
must plan carefully so that they meet all submission and deadline
requirements for applying to successive courses. Writing classes offered
by the UNC Friday Center for Continuing Education (correspondence,
independent study, online) do not count toward the minor.

ENGL 130, ENGL 131, ENGL 132H, ENGL 133H, and ENGL 138, the
introductory classes, are prerequisites to other Creative Writing Program
classes. ENGL 130, ENGL 131, and ENGL 138 are open for registration by
rising sophomores only during spring semester for the following fall and
for current sophomores only during fall semester for the following spring.
Rising or current sophomores may register for ENGL 130, ENGL 131, or
ENGL 138, but not for more than one of these three courses. Demand by
sophomores regularly exceeds the number of seats available. Enrollment
of juniors and seniors is on a space-available basis by permission of
the instructor, and students may inquire of the instructor during the
first week of classes to see if seats are available. ENGL 130, ENGL 131,
and ENGL 138 are sometimes offered during summer sessions with no
registration restrictions. Please always review summer session course
listings for any changes or updates.

Advancement to successive courses in either the fiction or poetry
sequence is by recommendation of the student’s previous instructor(s)
and by application for both the advanced workshops and senior honors
seminars. If possible, the student is assigned to a different instructor
for each course. Should students not advance beyond the intermediate
level, they may choose to finish the minor with other classes offered in
creative writing. Creative writing minors receive priority in all creative
writing classes and usually fill all seats.

Students completing the five courses for the minor may take additional
creative writing courses only by permission of the director, providing that
all other students still completing the minor are served first.

Again, please note that online courses do not count towards the creative
writing minor.
Transfer Students: Important Information
The requirement for taking a minor in creative writing is five courses or 15
semester hours. Students are limited to one creative writing course per
semester. Most junior transfer students have four semesters remaining.
Junior transfer students wanting to minor in creative writing must either

1. Have an introductory course already on their record that will transfer

to Carolina as credit, e.g., an introductory course in fiction writing
or poetry writing taken previously at a college or university that is
transferring in as credit for ENGL 130 or ENGL 131; OR

2. Take an introductory course via UNC–Chapel Hill Summer School
prior to their first fall term at Carolina and be promoted to the next
level or to another creative writing class (on a space-available basis)
in the fall of their junior year.

Permission to move forward with transfer credit for an introductory
course requirement (Option 1 above) will require a review by the creative

416         English Minor

writing faculty of the syllabus and work completed in the course and is
dependent on space availability, which cannot be guaranteed. Students
must provide hard copies of syllabi and samples of coursework as early
as possible in order to ensure time for review and to schedule a meeting
with the director.

Junior transfer students fulfilling one of these two options would be
eligible for Advanced Fiction or Poetry (ENGL 406 or ENGL 407) and the
senior honors seminars (ENGL 693H and ENGL 694H) if there is space
available in Intermediate Fiction (ENGL 206) or Intermediate Poetry
(ENGL 207) their first fall semester, and if—on the basis of submitted
work reviewed by a committee—they are chosen for those classes. If not,
they would need to complete the minor using the multigenre approach.

Note: No more than two creative writing courses from other schools may be
counted for credit at UNC–Chapel Hill. At least three of the five courses taken
for the minor—courses designated ENGL—must be Creative Writing Program
courses taken at Carolina.

Honors in Creating Writing

To qualify for a degree with honors or highest honors in creative
writing, students must maintain a 3.3 grade point average and meet all
requirements both to enter and to complete the senior honors seminar
(ENGL 693H and ENGL 694H).

Latina/o studies is constituted from the transdisciplinary study of Latina/
o cultural production and experience in terms of a whole variety of
factors. Latinas/os are defined as people of Latin American and Iberian
descent living and working or based in the United States, but also moving
between the United States and the rest of the Americas. Latina/o studies
takes as its primary concern the presence of Latin America, Spain, and
the myriad combinations of Hispanic-Native-African-Asian and European
non-Hispanic cultures within the borders of the United States. However,
Latina/o studies is not confined within those borders to the extent that its
subjects of study (and the very creators of the field itself) are in motion
and in flux, coming and going, crossing borders and boundaries. In this
respect it shares some of the transnational and transcultural scope,
momentum, and issues of Latin American studies but with its own foci,
its own perspectives. Latina/o studies does not duplicate the work of
Latin American studies; it draws on it and complements it.

Latina/o studies encompasses Chicana/o studies, Puerto Rican studies,
Cuban American studies, Dominican studies, Central American studies,
South American studies, and so forth. It takes into account the cultural
production and the socioeconomic and political experiences of a diverse
population located in many parts of the country, not just in the Southwest
borderlands.

The main stipulation of the minor is that students must take a
combination of courses in the humanities (literatures and cultural
production) and the social sciences (communities and cultural space),
some of which have been designated as core courses and others as
electives. Students who feel they need a basic introduction to Latina/o
studies should take ENGL 364.

The interdisciplinary honors minor in medicine, literature, and culture was
developed in collaboration with Honors Carolina and the Department of
Social Medicine in the UNC School of Medicine. It encourages students
to explore the cultural and historical dimensions of medical practice by
viewing the practice of medicine not simply as an application of chemical
and biological analyses of and interventions in the functioning of the
human body but also as a cultural practice embedded in changing ideas
of disease, health, doctors, patients, medical institutions, and ethics. The
minor is available to students accepted into Honors Carolina and to any
undergraduate student who has achieved and maintains a grade point
average of 3.00 or better.

Introduction

The Curriculum for the Environment and Ecology offers diverse and
multidisciplinary undergraduate degree programs in environmental
science (B.S.) and environmental studies (B.A.). Faculty throughout the
University, including the College of Arts and Sciences and the schools of
business, government, law, and public health, mentor students through
courses, internships, and research opportunities. This unique approach
provides students an opportunity to explore the knowledge base needed
to understand the environment and its relationship to society, as well
as the applications of that knowledge in areas such as environmental
modeling; aquatic systems; environmental behavior and decisions;
environmental change and human health; ecology, conservation, and
biodiversity; and population and the environment. The degrees combine
traditional classroom teaching with extensive use of interdisciplinary,
team-based projects, internships, study abroad opportunities, and
research.

Advising

The Curriculum for the Environment and Ecology maintains an advising
system for students with an environmental interest. Students are
encouraged to contact the director of undergraduate studies as early as
they wish in their academic plan to discuss options and be assigned to a
faculty advisor. Students may use the advising system from the time they
enter UNC–Chapel Hill, obtaining advice from specialists in the various
environmental fields. This advising system includes opportunities to
meet with professionals from government, industry, and consulting to
learn about the skills needed to work effectively in those fields if students
are interested. In addition we routinely schedule seminars and host
visitors who showcase career opportunities by their example in their
respective fields.

Facilities

Curriculum faculty members and staff occupy offices and laboratories in
Venable/Murray Halls (third floor) and the facilities in Manteo, Morehead
City, and Highlands, NC.

Graduate School and Career Opportunities

A major in environmental science or studies prepares students for
a variety of career options, including marine scientist, ecologist,
environmental modeler, environmental policy maker, conservation
advocate, land use planner, and environmental educator. Combining
either major with other studies at the undergraduate or graduate level

Dual Bachelor’s–Master’s Degree Program

Two dual bachelor’s–master’s programs are offered:

1. Environmental and Science Communication (esc.web.unc.edu (http://

esc.web.unc.edu)) is a collaboration between Environment and
Ecology and the School of Media and Journalism; and

2. Environmental Informatics (dualesis.web.unc.edu (http://

dualesis.web.unc.edu)) is a collaboration between Environment and
Ecology and the School of Information and Library Sciences.

Each program is designed for students to earn their bachelor’s degree
and complete a master’s degree in a professional school in as little as
five years. The dual degree in environmental and science communication
is approached through the bachelor’s of arts degree with a major in
environmental studies, and students then complete a master’s degree in
journalism. The dual degree in environmental informatics is approached

University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill            435

through the bachelor’s of science degree with a major in environmental
science, and students then complete a master’s in information sciences.

For the environmental science communication program, students
must complete the undergraduate requirements for the B.A. degree in
environmental studies and the graduate requirements for the M.A. degree
in mass communication as separate degrees. For the environmental
informatics program, students must complete the undergraduate
requirements for the B.S. degree in environmental sciences and the
graduate requirements for the M.S.I.S. degree in information sciences as
separate degrees. Students may begin taking courses for the graduate
degree while in the undergraduate program, and a limited number of
credit hours of approved graduate coursework may be transferred
into the graduate degree program in mass communication (up to nine
hours) and information sciences (up to 12 hours). Courses taken as an
undergraduate for graduate credit may not be counted as part of the
undergraduate degree if the intent is to transfer them to the graduate
program. Early advising is essential to success in navigating these dual-
degree programs. Advisors are available in both units to help students
prepare and select courses appropriately to get the most from their
education.

Applying for the dual-degree program is a two-step process. It is highly
recommend that interested first- and second-year students speak
to an advisor early in their college program. Students must submit a
conditional application to the program no later than their junior year
to ensure that they will receive preference in registering for courses.
Students must formally apply to the program through The Graduate
School in their senior year. The GRE is not required for applications
from current UNC–Chapel Hill students. For complete information on
the application process and curriculum requirements, please go to
esc.web.unc.edu (http://esc.web.unc.edu).

Special Opportunities in Environmental
Science and Studies
Honors in Environmental Science or Studies
Students in either the B.S. or B.A. degree program may participate
in honors research leading to graduation with honors or highest
honors. This distinction is earned by participation in honors research
(ENEC 693H) and culminates in ENEC 694H, thesis writing and defense.
Students should follow the guidelines established by Honors Carolina
and meet with the faculty honors advisor, Dr. Geoff Bell, to ensure that
appropriate requirements are fulfilled (Requirements can be found on
the Honors Program Web site (http://honorscarolina.unc.edu/current-
students/honors-thesis-and-undergraduate-research/honors-thesis)).
Honors students can use three credit hours of ENEC 693H (research)
or ENEC 694H (thesis), but not both courses, to fulfill a concentration
requirement.
Departmental Involvement
The Carolina Environmental Student Alliance (CESA) is an
interdisciplinary organization dedicated to uniting the environmental
interests of students across campus. Participation is open to all students
and community members with an interest in the environment. The
Epsilon Eta Environmental Honors Fraternity is an organization dedicated
to excellence in environmental education. Interested students are
nominated for membership.
Experiential Education
Possibilities for experiential education include APPLES service-learning
courses (ENEC 593), Coral Reef Ecology and Management (ENEC 259),

436         Environmental Science, B.S.

Sierra Nevada Program (ENEC 208), internships (ENEC 393, ENEC 493),
research (ENEC 395, ENEC 396, ENEC 698), and honors research
(ENEC 693H, ENEC 694H). Additionally, a series of experiential education
field sites is available in North Carolina and around the world where
students may take coursework and conduct research for a semester. Fall
semester field sites are offered in North Carolina at Highlands Biological
Station (mountain/ecology), the Institute for Marine Sciences (marine
ecology/geology), and the Coastal Studies Institute/Outer Banks (coastal
policy and economics). Spring semester field sites are offered on the
UNC campus (Sustainable Triangle field site), in Thailand (energy and
pollution), and Ecuador (ecology or sustainable development). The
Ecuador and Thailand field site experiences incorporate part of the
following summer as well. Summer programs are offered at Cambridge,
England (energy policy), and in the Galapagos (ecology). Contact our
advisors about other opportunities. Faculty members often arrange
Burch Program summer educational trips to such locations as Siberia,
Russia (ecology and anthropology), the Sierra Nevadas (ecology and
physical geography), and northern Europe (energy, sustainability, and
communication).
Internships
Students are encouraged to apply for paid or unpaid internships in
local, state, national, and international environmental organizations.
Internship opportunities can be found through the environmental
internships website (http://environmentalinternships.web.unc.edu).
These internships provide valuable practical experience, and some may
be conducted for academic credit.
Study Abroad
Exchange and other study abroad programs are available through the
UNC Study Abroad Office. At some locations students may take courses
for UNC credit, such as some field sites listed above. Students may take
courses at other universities during study abroad and apply for transfer
credit as well. We encourage students to participate in study abroad
during their career at Carolina.
Undergraduate Awards
Undergraduates may be considered for the Watts and Betsy Carr Awards,
Mary and Watts Hill Jr. Awards, and Robert Alonzo Winston Scholarships.
Undergraduate Research
All students are encouraged (but not required) to complete an
independent or team research project. Such projects introduce students
to the tools needed for graduate study. They also provide an important
opportunity for working directly with the world-class environmental
faculty members and graduate students at UNC–Chapel Hill, as well as
in the many environmental organizations in the Research Triangle. The
Triangle area contains one of the largest collections of environmental
organizations and expertise in the world, providing unique opportunities
for students to conduct research on an immense range of topics from
fundamental scientific research to policy applications.

Special Opportunities in Environmental
Science and Studies
Honors in Environmental Science or Studies
Students in either the B.S. or B.A. degree program may participate
in honors research leading to graduation with honors or highest
honors. This distinction is earned by participation in honors research
(ENEC 693H) and culminates in ENEC 694H, thesis writing and defense.
Students should follow the guidelines established by Honors Carolina
and meet with the faculty honors advisor, Dr. Geoff Bell, to ensure that
appropriate requirements are fulfilled (Requirements can be found on
the Honors Program Web site (http://honorscarolina.unc.edu/current-
students/honors-thesis-and-undergraduate-research/honors-thesis)).
Honors students can use three credit hours of ENEC 693H (research)
or ENEC 694H (thesis), but not both courses, to fulfill a concentration
requirement.
Departmental Involvement
The Carolina Environmental Student Alliance (CESA) is an
interdisciplinary organization dedicated to uniting the environmental
interests of students across campus. Participation is open to all students
and community members with an interest in the environment. The
Epsilon Eta Environmental Honors Fraternity is an organization dedicated
to excellence in environmental education. Interested students are
nominated for membership.
Experiential Education
Possibilities for experiential education include APPLES service-learning
courses (ENEC 593), Coral Reef Ecology and Management (ENEC 259),
Sierra Nevada Program (ENEC 208), internships (ENEC 393, ENEC 493),
research (ENEC 395, ENEC 396, ENEC 698), and honors research
(ENEC 693H, ENEC 694H). Additionally, a series of experiential education
field sites is available in North Carolina and around the world where
students may take coursework and conduct research for a semester. Fall
semester field sites are offered in North Carolina at Highlands Biological
Station (mountain/ecology), the Institute for Marine Sciences (marine
ecology/geology), and the Coastal Studies Institute/Outer Banks (coastal
policy and economics). Spring semester field sites are offered on the
UNC campus (Sustainable Triangle field site), in Thailand (energy and
pollution), and Ecuador (ecology or sustainable development). The
Ecuador and Thailand field site experiences incorporate part of the
following summer as well. Summer programs are offered at Cambridge,
England (energy policy), and in the Galapagos (ecology). Contact our
advisors about other opportunities. Faculty members often arrange
Burch Program summer educational trips to such locations as Siberia,
Russia (ecology and anthropology), the Sierra Nevadas (ecology and
physical geography), and northern Europe (energy, sustainability, and
communication).
Internships
Students are encouraged to apply for paid or unpaid internships in
local, state, national, and international environmental organizations.
Internship opportunities can be found through the environmental
internships website (http://environmentalinternships.web.unc.edu).
These internships provide valuable practical experience, and some may
be conducted for academic credit.

Study Abroad
Exchange and other study abroad programs are available through the
UNC Study Abroad Office. At some locations students may take courses
for UNC credit, such as some field sites listed above. Students may take
courses at other universities during study abroad and apply for transfer
credit as well. We encourage students to participate in study abroad
during their career at Carolina.
Undergraduate Awards
Undergraduates may be considered for the Watts and Betsy Carr Awards,
Mary and Watts Hill Jr. Awards, and Robert Alonzo Winston Scholarships.
Undergraduate Research
All students are encouraged (but not required) to complete an
independent or team research project. Such projects introduce students
to the tools needed for graduate study. They also provide an important
opportunity for working directly with the world-class environmental
faculty members and graduate students at UNC–Chapel Hill, as well as
in the many environmental organizations in the Research Triangle. The
Triangle area contains one of the largest collections of environmental
organizations and expertise in the world, providing unique opportunities
for students to conduct research on an immense range of topics from
fundamental scientific research to policy applications.

Introduction

The Department of Environmental Sciences and Engineering combines
the physical sciences, health sciences, engineering, and policy to address
current and emerging environmental challenges. This multidisciplinary
approach provides unique academic and research opportunities for
students.

Advising

Student advising is overseen by the director of undergraduate studies;
individual student advising is distributed among the department’s faculty
members. Students interested in one of the concentrations will be
advised and mentored by an environmental sciences and engineering
faculty member whose expertise is relevant to the concentration. The
program director and staff in the Student Services Office will verify
that coursework requirements for the concentration have been met.
Undergraduate students are encouraged to meet regularly with the
program director and review their Tar Heel Tracker each semester. The
program director and the Office of Student Services staff work with
current and prospective majors by appointment (see contact information
above). Departmental academic advising is particularly important for
those majors who are considering going on to the dual bachelor’s–
master’s degree. Further information on courses, undergraduate research
opportunities, the honors program, careers, and graduate schools may be
obtained from the department’s Web site.

Facilities

The Department of Environmental Sciences and Engineering houses
research laboratories located in Rosenau Hall, McGavran-Greenberg
Hall, Michael Hooker Research Center, the Baity Building, and off-
campus research facilities. These laboratories are involved in important
research in water quality, biogeochemistry, atmospheric chemistry
and air pollution, effects of environmental chemicals on DNA tissues
and organisms, environmental and public health microbiology, and
occupational health and safety.

The department also offers facilities for modeling and computational
analysis of environmental systems, such as atmospheric circulation
and air quality models, ground and surface water flow and transport
models, fluid flow and contaminant transport models for indoor air
environments, exposure analysis and health effects, risk assessment, and
environmental epidemiology.

More detailed information about the individual laboratories and centers
can be found at the department Web site (http://www.sph.unc.edu/envr).

Graduate School and Career Opportunities

While undergraduate education prepares students for citizenship in ways
that go beyond professional concerns, the program in environmental
health sciences also provides skills needed for employment and graduate
study. Students ending their studies at the undergraduate level gain skills
necessary to work in positions such as risk analysts in consulting firms
and regulatory agencies; research assistants in local, state, and national
environmental and environmental health departments; and scientific
advisors to environmental organizations. The degree also prepares
students for graduate study in the environmental sciences, environmental
health sciences, environmental studies, toxicology, and professional
disciplines such as medicine, environmental law, and public health.

Undergraduate students with appropriate science backgrounds have the
opportunity to pursue a dual bachelor’s–master’s degree. This program
allows students to complete a master’s degree in the department
within one additional year of study beyond receipt of the bachelor’s
degree. Interested students should read the program description and
requirements carefully; they can be found online (http://sph.unc.edu/
envr/envr-degrees).

Students have opportunities to explore possibilities for employment
through the rich network of connections among the department,
University, and numerous environmental organizations in the Research
Triangle Park area, which is home to the highest concentration of
environmental health sciences groups in the nation.

Introduction

The Curriculum in Contemporary European Studies is designed to provide
students with

1. a broad interdisciplinary understanding of modern Europe and the

European Union;

2. a focused understanding of contemporary Europe from the

perspective of a selected social science discipline; and
3. advanced proficiency in a modern European language.

Students are especially encouraged to combine the major with a second
major in a noninterdisciplinary field such as political science, economics,
or history. Through its unique combination of advanced coursework
and language training, the curriculum provides the intellectual building
blocks to study contemporary Europe through a sophisticated framework.
Students completing the major will be well prepared for graduate
or professional study of contemporary Europe and for a range of
international careers.

Advising

In addition to the guidance provided by the primary academic advisors
in Steele Building, contemporary European studies majors receive
individualized advising at all stages of academic planning, including
considering courses, internships, study abroad options, graduate
programs, and career paths. Students interested in pursuing a major
in contemporary European studies are encouraged to meet with the
curriculum advisor as early as possible in their undergraduate career to
design a comprehensive and efficient course plan and take full advantage
of study abroad and other international education opportunities.
Consult the curriculum Web site (http://europe.unc.edu/euro) for further
information on courses, funding awards, and campus resources.

Introduction

Exercise and sport science examines the physics, physiology, and
psychology of sport and exercise; the recognition and treatment of
athletic injuries; and the administration of athletics. The general major
provides foundational courses in exercise science. The athletic training
program within the Department of Exercise and Sport Science can
prepare students to work as a certified athletic trainer for high school,
college, or professional sports teams. Students interested in sport
administration can build a foundation in the management of sport.
Sport administration career options include almost anything related to
amateur, interscholastic, or professional sports. The fitness professional
program is designed to prepare students for careers in a variety of health-
related fields, including but not limited to entry-level positions in the
health-fitness industry; personal training of amateur, professional, and
recreational athletes; exercise therapy for a range of clinical conditions;
or graduate study in exercise physiology. Other career options for majors
include strength-conditioning coach for an athletic team; exercise
research within the athletic, medical, or pharmaceutical industries; or
fitness club entrepreneur. By choosing additional courses, students can
apply to schools of physical therapy, occupational therapy, public health,
nursing, or medicine.

The overall mission of the Department of Exercise and Sport Science is to
discover and promote knowledge of human movement to improve quality
of life.

Advising

All majors and minors have a primary academic advisor in Steele
Building. Students are strongly encouraged to meet regularly with
their advisor and review their Tar Heel Tracker each semester. In the
Department of Exercise and Sport Science five faculty members serve
as advisors with weekly office hours (see "Programs" above and contact
information on the Web site). The department communicates via a
listserv, Facebook posts, tweets, blog posts, classroom “advising”
visits, bulletin boards/video boards throughout the building, and the
departmental Web site (http://exss.unc.edu). Departmental academic
advising is particularly important for those majors who are considering
graduate school. Further information on courses, undergraduate research
opportunities, the honors program, careers, and graduate schools may be
obtained from the department’s Web site (http://exss.unc.edu).

Facilities

In addition to classroom space and physical activity area, Fetzer Hall
houses several well-equipped research and teaching laboratories:

1. The Applied Physiology Laboratory is fully equipped to measure

metabolism, body composition, and aerobic fitness. Additionally, it
houses a chemistry laboratory to study the biochemistry of exercise.

2. The Cadaver Anatomy Laboratory is designed to teach cadaver

dissection in order to gain a greater knowledge about how the human
body works in an athletic environment.

3. The Exercise Science Teaching Laboratory was specifically designed

for teaching exercise science laboratory experiences as well as
clinical exercise testing experiences.

4. The Sports Medicine Research Laboratory, equipped with the latest

equipment to investigate athletic injuries related to the biomechanics

Introduction

Geography is the science of space, place, and environment. The
department offers classes spanning the social and natural sciences and
offering students training in qualitative, quantitative, spatial analysis
and modelling, and laboratory methodologies. Human geographers
study the spatial aspects of human activity and physical geographers
study patterns of climate, land forms, soils and water. Geographic tools
and techniques—including Geographic Information Systems, remote
sensing, and online and interactive mapping technologies—are among
the most important for exploring and understanding our complex world.
Geographic inquiry is global and local, inherently interdisciplinary, and
offers skills that enable insights into pressing issues valued by employers
and policy makers. For example, how does climate change impact the
way we build cities? How does globalization influence where your jeans
are made? How can health disparities between people be overcome
through policy change? By synthesizing this knowledge, geographers
create unique understandings of our complex world.

Career opportunities for geographers are wide ranging in the public,
private, and nongovernmental sectors. Geographers work in the areas
of social, health, and environmental policy; energy, transportation,
economic, development, and tourism planning; urban and regional
planning; research and education; community development; resource
management; and environmental regulation and modeling.

With geography you can explore the world and find yourself.

Advising

All majors and minors have a primary academic advisor in Steele
Building. Students are strongly encouraged to meet regularly with their
advisor and review Tar Heel Tracker each semester. The department’s
director of undergraduate studies works with current and prospective
majors by appointment and during regular office hours (see department
Web site as hours will vary by semester). Departmental academic
advising is highly recommended for all majors, in particular those
considering graduate school. Further information on courses,
undergraduate research opportunities, the honors program, careers, and
graduate schools may be obtained from the department’s Web site.

Facilities

The department has a range of specialized, state-of-the-art equipment for
geospatial field sampling and laboratory analysis of data in hydrology,
climatology, and vegetation science, including an ecohydrology
laboratory and a dendrology laboratory. The department is wired
internally to support the latest network technology. This network links

us to the centrally managed servers that provide access to a large
library of software for geographic applications and research, as well as
first-class library resources, data storage and backup, and access to
supercomputing clusters.

Graduate School and Career Opportunities

There are a variety of job opportunities for geographers in government,
business, industry, and the nonprofit sector. Geographers are hired
for the following kinds of expertise: locational analysis, GISci, remote
sensing, cartography, land use planning, recreation and tourism planning,
and foreign area expertise. Many geographers pursue teaching at all
levels.

Students with a B.A. major in geography from UNC–Chapel Hill are
well trained for graduate programs in geography and other disciplines.
Majors have entered graduate programs as diverse as city and regional
planning, business, medicine, and ecology. For more information about
careers in geography, the UNC–Chapel Hill Department of Geography,
degree requirements, and connections to other sites of interest, visit the
department's Web site at geography.unc.edu (http://geography.unc.edu).

Geography is the science of space, place, and environment. The
department offers classes spanning the social and natural sciences and
offering students training in qualitative, quantitative, spatial analysis and
modelling, and lab methodologies. Human geographers study the spatial
aspects of human activity, and physical geographers study patterns of
climate, land forms, soils, and water. Geographic tools and techniques—
including Geographic Information Systems, remote sensing, and online
and interactive mapping technologies—are among the most important
for exploring and understanding our complex world. Geographic inquiry is
global and local, inherently interdisciplinary, and offers skills that enable
insights into pressing issues valued by employers and policy makers.

Career opportunities for geographers are wide ranging in the public,
private, and nongovernmental sectors. Geographers work in the areas
of social, health, and environmental policy; energy, transportation,
economic development, and tourism planning; urban and regional
planning; research and education; community development; resource
management; and environmental regulation and modeling.

With geography you can explore the world and find yourself.

Introduction

The study of earth’s dynamic systems is a field that has seen major
advances over the last few decades. Geologists investigate diverse
systems that play a large role in controlling the environment at the earth’s
surface. Examples include earthquakes, volcanoes, glaciers, landslides,
rivers, and shorelines. Earth processes play a critical role in making
our planet habitable, and geologists are constantly in demand to guide
communities and nations in their search for resources such as clean
drinking water and extractable energy and minerals, or in decisions
regarding development in fragile coastal regions or in seismically active
areas. The Department of Geological Sciences provides students with
a solid training in earth science so that they can advance in highly
satisfying careers as professional geologists.

Most students planning to do graduate work or to become professional
geologists should follow the B.S. program. However, the flexibility of
the B.A. program may be advantageous to students with interest in, for
example, environmental studies, education, or law.

Advising

All majors and minors have a primary academic advisor in Steele
Building. Students are strongly encouraged to meet regularly with
their advisor and review their Tar Heel Tracker each semester. The
department’s director of undergraduate studies works with current and
prospective majors by appointment. Departmental academic advising is
particularly important for those majors who are considering going on to
graduate school. Further information on courses, undergraduate research
opportunities, the honors program, careers, and graduate schools may be
obtained from the department’s Web site.

Facilities

The Department of Geological Sciences houses several laboratory
facilities that are available for undergraduate students to use for
research. Many students are introduced to the laboratory facilities
through coursework. Laboratories include

1. a thermal ionization mass spectrometer for isotope and

geochronology research;

2. a scanning electron microscope laboratory for image analysis,

element mapping, and semi-quantitative chemical analysis;
3. an X-ray fluorescence spectrometer for chemical analysis of

geological materials;

4. an X-ray diffractometer for rapid mineral identification;

5. a direct current plasma spectrometer for analysis of major and minor

elements in sample solutions;

6. equipment for geophysical research and imaging, including portable
broadband seismic stations, infrasonic microphones, a gravimeter,
and equipment for ship-borne reflection seismology;

7. a sediment analysis laboratory including a coulometer, settling tube,

and laser particle size counter;

8. chemical and counting laboratories for quantifying natural and

artificial radioactivity at environmental levels;

9. a paleoclimate/paleoecology laboratory equipped for high-resolution

microsampling of carbonate samples for geochemical analysis.

Graduate School and Career Opportunities

Geologists commonly are employed by private industry, public and
private schools, colleges and universities, and consulting firms (e.g.,
hydrology, environmental geology, engineering geology, petroleum
geology, and mineral exploration). Geology graduates also can find
jobs with federal or state geological surveys or with other federal/state
environmental or energy firms. Some federal/state agencies prefer
geologists with at least a master’s degree. A doctoral degree usually is
required for employment at colleges and universities.

two semesters in residence. The research project should represent the
equivalent time expenditure of six hours of course credit and is taken as
GEOL 691H (fall semester) and GEOL 692H (spring semester).

Upon recommendation of the faculty, students may be awarded the
degree with honors or highest honors. Highest honors is reserved for
students who have distinguished themselves in both coursework and
independent research. In order to obtain this distinction the student must
maintain a grade point average of 3.60 or higher and complete a research
project that is worthy of peer-reviewed publication.
Departmental Involvement
The Department of Geological Sciences encourages the active
participation of undergraduates in department research, teaching, and
social life. In addition to opportunities for experiential education and
teaching internships described below, the department has an active
Geology Honor Fraternity and Geology Club and regularly sponsors field
excursions, career information sessions, and social events. Dates, times,
and locations for all events are posted on the Web site and in the main
lobby on the first floor of Mitchell Hall.
Experiential Education

two semesters in residence. The research project should represent the
equivalent time expenditure of six hours of course credit and is taken as
GEOL 691H (fall semester) and GEOL 692H (spring semester).

Upon recommendation of the faculty, students may be awarded the
degree with honors or highest honors. Highest honors is reserved for
students who have distinguished themselves in both coursework and
independent research. In order to obtain this distinction the student must
maintain a grade point average of 3.60 or higher and complete a research
project that is worthy of peer-reviewed publication.
Departmental Involvement

Introduction

The Department of Germanic and Slavic Languages and Literatures
conducts research and offers instruction in the languages, literatures,
and cultures of central, northern, and eastern Europe and northern Asia.
It offers multiple tracks for undergraduate study for those interested
in German programs (two concentrations), Slavic programs (two
concentrations), and Central European studies (one concentration).
A major in Germanic and Slavic languages and literatures provides
preparatory training that will be useful in government employment;
internationally oriented business, journalism, law, and teaching; as well
as graduate study in a range of humanistic and social science disciplines.

Advising

Students can complete any concentration, even if they have no prior
experience in the language, provided that they begin taking their language
courses as first-year students.

All majors and minors have a primary academic advisor in Steele
Building. Students should meet regularly with their primary advisor and
review their Tar Heel Tracker each semester.

However, departmental academic advising is also important for
all students majoring or minoring in the department. Current and
prospective majors and minors should confer with the department’s
director of undergraduate studies (for German literature and
culture, German media, arts, and culture), or the department’s Slavic
undergraduate advisor (for Russian language and culture and Slavic
languages and cultures), or the department’s Central European advisor
(for the Central European studies concentration). The director of
undergraduate studies, the Slavic undergraduate advisor, or the
Central European undergraduate advisor may all approve study abroad,
internship, and transfer credit, and/or serve as an honors advisor, as
appropriate for the concentrations they work with.

Students seeking certification to teach German or Russian in public
schools should consult advisors in the School of Education.

Graduate School and Career Opportunities

In an age of rapid internationalization and globalization, proficiency in
a foreign language is no longer just an auxiliary skill but a necessary
one. Courses offered in the department make up an important part of
a liberal education, and a major can provide excellent preparation for
many careers, particularly when the major is combined with courses in
business, economics, political science, journalism, and various other

University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill            511

fields. Recent graduates have entered careers in international business,
journalism, publishing, and the travel industry.

A bachelor of arts with a major in Germanic and Slavic languages
and literatures also qualifies graduates for positions in the United
States State Department and other government agencies, educational
organizations, foundations, and travel organizations. The presence
of over 100 German and Swiss firms in the Carolinas testifies to the
demand for a high degree of German linguistic and cultural literacy
in college graduates. The department is also one among very few in
the United States that offers a range of critical and/or less commonly
taught languages of Eastern Europe and the former USSR. People who
know these languages are in particularly high demand in business and
government. A graduate who has successfully taken the internationally-
recognized business German examination “Wirtschaftsdeutsch als
Fremdsprache” at UNC–Chapel Hill has an edge in seeking such
positions.

In addition, the demand for language teachers provides career
opportunities for those German and Russian majors who receive teaching
certification from the School of Education.

German and Slavic majors often go on to graduate programs in
comparative literature, linguistics, history, law, international business and
management, international relations, professional translation, medicine,
and education. Some pursue careers as college professors. Many
Chapel Hill German and Slavic majors have been welcomed by the most
prestigious graduate programs in the country. The department’s faculty
members can assist undergraduate majors in selecting appropriate
graduate programs.

Special Opportunities in Germanic and
Slavic Languages and Literatures
Honors in Germanic and Slavic Languages and
Literatures
Students majoring in Germanic and Slavic languages and literatures who
are qualified for honors work are strongly encouraged to consider taking
honors during their senior year. Undertaking an honors project gives
students the opportunity to explore a topic in depth under the direction
of a faculty member. Seniors who wish to do honors work should confer
with the director of undergraduate studies and choose an honors thesis
advisor during the second semester of their junior year, and enroll during
their senior year in GSLL 691H (honors reading and special studies)
followed by GSLL 692H (writing the honors thesis). When GSLL 693H is
offered, the course replaces GSLL 692H and provides an opportunity for
students majoring in any of our concentrations to complete their thesis in
the context of a small seminar with other honors students. One of these
honors courses may count toward the major.
Student Involvement and Cultural Enrichment beyond
the Classroom
Numerous social and educational events hosted by the department,
as well as by student clubs such as the German Club, provide an
atmosphere for effective learning and for enjoying German and Slavic
culture. There are weekly opportunities in German, Russian, and other
languages for informal conversation suitable for both beginning and
advanced students. The department periodically sponsors lectures,
roundtables, small conferences, and film series for the various languages.
Those considering an undergraduate major or minor should request to be
added to the appropriate e-mail listserv for information regarding special
events and opportunities.

530         Germanic and Slavic Languages and Literatures Major, B.A.–German Literature and Culture Concentration

The department also hosts receptions and informational meetings for
students interested in pursuing a major or minor or seeking opportunities
for internships, study abroad, graduate study, and employment in
Germany, Russia, and Eastern or Central Europe. Every spring the
department presents a Slavic and East European talent night, or
Spektakl’, featuring skits, songs, puppet shows, plays, and poetry
readings in the Slavic and East European languages students are
learning. The department also presents full-length plays and dramatic
readings in German performed by undergraduate students.
Study Abroad
The department encourages students to study and/or engage in
internships abroad. These opportunities maximize students’ linguistic
and cultural proficiency, particularly once they have acquired sufficient
language skills to benefit most from this immersion experience. Students
may participate for a whole year, a single term, or a summer.

The Study Abroad Office offers German programs at all universities
in the German state of Baden-Württemberg, as well as a dedicated
exchange program with the Eberhard-Karls-Universität Tübingen; at the
Vienna (Austria) University of Economics and Business Administration;
at the Science Exchanges in Berlin or Jena (Germany) and Vienna; at
the IES European Union Program in Freiburg (Germany); and at the
IES Music Studies Program in Vienna. Most German programs require
that participating students have passed GERM 204 (or its equivalent);
however, students with no prior knowledge of German may attend the
FUBiS or FU-BEST programs in Berlin or the IES program in Freiburg.
These programs generally include intensive language instruction in
addition to content courses taught in English, and most programs offer
an orientation course prior to the start of the semester. The yearlong term
typically begins in late August and ends in late July, with a two-month
vacation between semesters that many students use for travel. Students
going abroad for only one term generally do so in the spring semester,
which typically begins in late February and ends in late July.

The DAAD in conjunction with German universities usually offers some
summer internships. An internship is also available in Dresden. Please
see an undergraduate advisor in the department office about these
opportunities.

Students who choose to study Dutch may study abroad in Amsterdam
through the IES, or attend SIT Netherlands’ Program “International
Perspective on Sexuality and Gender.” Exchange programs also are
offered in Nijmegen and Groningen.

Students can study in semester or yearlong programs in Russia, including
in Moscow, St. Petersburg, and Vladimir, while earning credit towards
their Carolina degree. Students also may participate in the ACTR Moscow
summer program in Russia. UNC–Chapel Hill offers four semester-
long programs and one summer program in the Czech Republic. For
more information about these and other programs in eastern and
central Europe, go to studyabroad.unc.edu. Majors and minors should
consult with the director of undergraduate studies or the appropriate
undergraduate advisor in advance of going abroad about courses they
plan to take for the major or minor.
Languages across the Curriculum
The Languages across the Curriculum (LAC) Program encourages
majors and minors to enroll in one-credit-hour recitation or discussion
sections that are conducted in German but associated with a variety
of courses offered in English by other academic departments. German
language recitation sections may also be scheduled in conjunction with
several of the department’s courses offered in English. Each of these

discussion and recitation sections counts as one German language credit
(in addition to the credit granted for the course).
Undergraduate Awards
Membership in the Beta Rho chapter of Delta Phi Alpha, the German
honors society, is available to majors and minors who have completed
at least six credit hours of German language coursework at the 300 level
and who have maintained high cumulative grade point averages and high
grade point averages in the major.

The department selects annually one outstanding graduating senior
majoring in German to receive the Undergraduate Ria Stambaugh Award
for Excellence in German, a monetary award that is presented at the
Chancellor’s Awards Ceremony each spring. Ria Stambaugh was a
popular professor of German; after her death in 1984 her sister, friends,
and colleagues contributed to a memorial fund to establish the Ria
Stambaugh Awards. The undergraduate award was first presented in
1987.

Established in 1999, the Paul Debreczeny Prize is awarded each spring to
a graduating senior whose work in Slavic languages and literatures has
been judged outstanding. This monetary prize honors one of the founding
faculty members of the program in Slavic languages and literatures.
Undergraduate Research
In addition to honors thesis work, students are encouraged to work on
course-complementary or independent research projects with department
faculty. Funding may be available through the Office of Undergraduate
Research.

Special Opportunities in Germanic and
Slavic Languages and Literatures
Honors in Germanic and Slavic Languages and
Literatures
Students majoring in Germanic and Slavic languages and literatures who
are qualified for honors work are strongly encouraged to consider taking
honors during their senior year. Undertaking an honors project gives
students the opportunity to explore a topic in depth under the direction
of a faculty member. Seniors who wish to do honors work should confer
with the director of undergraduate studies and choose an honors thesis
advisor during the second semester of their junior year, and enroll during
their senior year in GSLL 691H (honors reading and special studies)
followed by GSLL 692H (writing the honors thesis). When GSLL 693H is
offered, the course replaces GSLL 692H and provides an opportunity for
students majoring in any of our concentrations to complete their thesis in
the context of a small seminar with other honors students. One of these
honors courses may count toward the major.
Student Involvement and Cultural Enrichment beyond
the Classroom
Numerous social and educational events hosted by the department,
as well as by student clubs such as the German Club, provide an
atmosphere for effective learning and for enjoying German and Slavic
culture. There are weekly opportunities in German, Russian, and other
languages for informal conversation suitable for both beginning and
advanced students. The department periodically sponsors lectures,

532         Germanic and Slavic Languages and Literatures Major, B.A.–German Media, Arts, and Culture Concentration

roundtables, small conferences, and film series for the various languages.
Those considering an undergraduate major or minor should request to be
added to the appropriate e-mail listserv for information regarding special
events and opportunities.

The department also hosts receptions and informational meetings for
students interested in pursuing a major or minor or seeking opportunities
for internships, study abroad, graduate study, and employment in
Germany, Russia, and Eastern or Central Europe. Every spring the
department presents a Slavic and East European talent night, or
Spektakl’, featuring skits, songs, puppet shows, plays, and poetry
readings in the Slavic and East European languages students are
learning. The department also presents full-length plays and dramatic
readings in German performed by undergraduate students.
Study Abroad
The department encourages students to study and/or engage in
internships abroad. These opportunities maximize students’ linguistic
and cultural proficiency, particularly once they have acquired sufficient
language skills to benefit most from this immersion experience. Students
may participate for a whole year, a single term, or a summer.

The Study Abroad Office offers German programs at all universities
in the German state of Baden-Württemberg, as well as a dedicated
exchange program with the Eberhard-Karls-Universität Tübingen; at the
Vienna (Austria) University of Economics and Business Administration;
at the Science Exchanges in Berlin or Jena (Germany) and Vienna; at
the IES European Union Program in Freiburg (Germany); and at the
IES Music Studies Program in Vienna. Most German programs require
that participating students have passed GERM 204 (or its equivalent);
however, students with no prior knowledge of German may attend the
FUBiS or FU-BEST programs in Berlin or the IES program in Freiburg.
These programs generally include intensive language instruction in
addition to content courses taught in English, and most programs offer
an orientation course prior to the start of the semester. The yearlong term
typically begins in late August and ends in late July, with a two-month
vacation between semesters that many students use for travel. Students
going abroad for only one term generally do so in the spring semester,
which typically begins in late February and ends in late July.

The DAAD in conjunction with German universities usually offers some
summer internships. An internship is also available in Dresden. Please
see an undergraduate advisor in the department office about these
opportunities.

Students who choose to study Dutch may study abroad in Amsterdam
through the IES, or attend SIT Netherlands’ Program “International
Perspective on Sexuality and Gender.” Exchange programs also are
offered in Nijmegen and Groningen.

Students can study in semester or yearlong programs in Russia, including
in Moscow, St. Petersburg, and Vladimir, while earning credit towards
their Carolina degree. Students also may participate in the ACTR Moscow
summer program in Russia. UNC–Chapel Hill offers four semester-
long programs and one summer program in the Czech Republic. For
more information about these and other programs in eastern and
central Europe, go to studyabroad.unc.edu. Majors and minors should
consult with the director of undergraduate studies or the appropriate
undergraduate advisor in advance of going abroad about courses they
plan to take for the major or minor.

Languages across the Curriculum
The Languages across the Curriculum (LAC) Program encourages
majors and minors to enroll in one-credit-hour recitation or discussion
sections that are conducted in German but associated with a variety
of courses offered in English by other academic departments. German
language recitation sections may also be scheduled in conjunction with
several of the department’s courses offered in English. Each of these
discussion and recitation sections counts as one German language credit
(in addition to the credit granted for the course).
Undergraduate Awards
Membership in the Beta Rho chapter of Delta Phi Alpha, the German
honors society, is available to majors and minors who have completed
at least six credit hours of German language coursework at the 300 level
and who have maintained high cumulative grade point averages and high
grade point averages in the major.

The department selects annually one outstanding graduating senior
majoring in German to receive the Undergraduate Ria Stambaugh Award
for Excellence in German, a monetary award that is presented at the
Chancellor’s Awards Ceremony each spring. Ria Stambaugh was a
popular professor of German; after her death in 1984 her sister, friends,
and colleagues contributed to a memorial fund to establish the Ria
Stambaugh Awards. The undergraduate award was first presented in
1987.

Established in 1999, the Paul Debreczeny Prize is awarded each spring to
a graduating senior whose work in Slavic languages and literatures has
been judged outstanding. This monetary prize honors one of the founding
faculty members of the program in Slavic languages and literatures.
Undergraduate Research
In addition to honors thesis work, students are encouraged to work on
course-complementary or independent research projects with department
faculty. Funding may be available through the Office of Undergraduate
Research.

The Study Abroad Office offers German programs at all universities
in the German state of Baden-Württemberg, as well as a dedicated
exchange program with the Eberhard-Karls-Universität Tübingen; at the
Vienna (Austria) University of Economics and Business Administration;
at the Science Exchanges in Berlin or Jena (Germany) and Vienna; at
the IES European Union Program in Freiburg (Germany); and at the
IES Music Studies Program in Vienna. Most German programs require
that participating students have passed GERM 204 (or its equivalent);
however, students with no prior knowledge of German may attend the

FUBiS or FU-BEST programs in Berlin or the IES program in Freiburg.
These programs generally include intensive language instruction in
addition to content courses taught in English, and most programs offer
an orientation course prior to the start of the semester. The yearlong term
typically begins in late August and ends in late July, with a two-month
vacation between semesters that many students use for travel. Students
going abroad for only one term generally do so in the spring semester,
which typically begins in late February and ends in late July.

The DAAD in conjunction with German universities usually offers some
summer internships. An internship is also available in Dresden. Please
see an undergraduate advisor in the department office about these
opportunities.

Students who choose to study Dutch may study abroad in Amsterdam
through the IES, or attend SIT Netherlands’ Program “International
Perspective on Sexuality and Gender.” Exchange programs also are
offered in Nijmegen and Groningen.

Students can study in semester or yearlong programs in Russia, including
in Moscow, St. Petersburg, and Vladimir, while earning credit towards
their Carolina degree. Students also may participate in the ACTR Moscow
summer program in Russia. UNC–Chapel Hill offers four semester-
long programs and one summer program in the Czech Republic. For
more information about these and other programs in eastern and
central Europe, go to studyabroad.unc.edu. Majors and minors should
consult with the director of undergraduate studies or the appropriate
undergraduate advisor in advance of going abroad about courses they
plan to take for the major or minor.
Languages across the Curriculum
The Languages across the Curriculum (LAC) Program encourages
majors and minors to enroll in one-credit-hour recitation or discussion
sections that are conducted in German but associated with a variety
of courses offered in English by other academic departments. German
language recitation sections may also be scheduled in conjunction with
several of the department’s courses offered in English. Each of these
discussion and recitation sections counts as one German language credit
(in addition to the credit granted for the course).
Undergraduate Awards
Membership in the Beta Rho chapter of Delta Phi Alpha, the German
honors society, is available to majors and minors who have completed
at least six credit hours of German language coursework at the 300 level
and who have maintained high cumulative grade point averages and high
grade point averages in the major.

The department selects annually one outstanding graduating senior
majoring in German to receive the Undergraduate Ria Stambaugh Award
for Excellence in German, a monetary award that is presented at the
Chancellor’s Awards Ceremony each spring. Ria Stambaugh was a
popular professor of German; after her death in 1984 her sister, friends,
and colleagues contributed to a memorial fund to establish the Ria
Stambaugh Awards. The undergraduate award was first presented in
1987.

Established in 1999, the Paul Debreczeny Prize is awarded each spring to
a graduating senior whose work in Slavic languages and literatures has
been judged outstanding. This monetary prize honors one of the founding
faculty members of the program in Slavic languages and literatures.

Special Opportunities in Germanic and
Slavic Languages and Literatures
Honors in Germanic and Slavic Languages and
Literatures
Students majoring in Germanic and Slavic languages and literatures who
are qualified for honors work are strongly encouraged to consider taking
honors during their senior year. Undertaking an honors project gives
students the opportunity to explore a topic in depth under the direction
of a faculty member. Seniors who wish to do honors work should confer
with the director of undergraduate studies and choose an honors thesis
advisor during the second semester of their junior year, and enroll during
their senior year in GSLL 691H (honors reading and special studies)
followed by GSLL 692H (writing the honors thesis). When GSLL 693H is
offered, the course replaces GSLL 692H and provides an opportunity for
students majoring in any of our concentrations to complete their thesis in
the context of a small seminar with other honors students. One of these
honors courses may count toward the major.
Student Involvement and Cultural Enrichment beyond
the Classroom
Numerous social and educational events hosted by the department,
as well as by student clubs such as the German Club, provide an
atmosphere for effective learning and for enjoying German and Slavic
culture. There are weekly opportunities in German, Russian, and other
languages for informal conversation suitable for both beginning and
advanced students. The department periodically sponsors lectures,
roundtables, small conferences, and film series for the various languages.
Those considering an undergraduate major or minor should request to be
added to the appropriate e-mail listserv for information regarding special
events and opportunities.

The department also hosts receptions and informational meetings for
students interested in pursuing a major or minor or seeking opportunities
for internships, study abroad, graduate study, and employment in

Germany, Russia, and Eastern or Central Europe. Every spring the
department presents a Slavic and East European talent night, or
Spektakl’, featuring skits, songs, puppet shows, plays, and poetry
readings in the Slavic and East European languages students are
learning. The department also presents full-length plays and dramatic
readings in German performed by undergraduate students.
Study Abroad
The department encourages students to study and/or engage in
internships abroad. These opportunities maximize students’ linguistic
and cultural proficiency, particularly once they have acquired sufficient
language skills to benefit most from this immersion experience. Students
may participate for a whole year, a single term, or a summer.

The Study Abroad Office offers German programs at all universities
in the German state of Baden-Württemberg, as well as a dedicated

Introduction

Globalization of the economy, cross-cultural relations, international
media, ecological crises, and political transformations are all making
international studies more important today. The Curriculum in Global
Studies offers an interdisciplinary program of study focusing on these
and many other issues. It draws on courses throughout the social
sciences, humanities, and professional schools and offers students the
chance to concentrate on an area of the world and a theme of global
significance.

Students prepare for careers in business, diplomacy, international aid,
economic development, and other forms of public service. The global
studies major is also excellent preparation for graduate school in one of
the social sciences, in professions such as law, business, and journalism,
or in international affairs and area studies. About 450 juniors and seniors
major in global studies.

Advising

All majors and minors have a primary academic advisor in Steele
Building. Students are strongly encouraged to meet regularly with
their advisor and review their Tar Heel Tracker each semester. The
department’s director of undergraduate studies works with current
and prospective majors by appointment (see “Contact Information”
above) to discuss major requirements, how study abroad credits transfer
into the major, and other issues of relevance to global studies. Further
information on courses, the honors program, internships, and more are
available on the department’s Web site.

Graduate School and Career Opportunities

Global studies majors are prepared for careers in business, diplomacy,
international aid and economic development, and other forms of public
service. The major is also excellent preparation for graduate school
in one of the social sciences; in professions such as law, business, or
journalism; or in international affairs and area studies. Career resources

Additional Information
The curriculum urges that in addition to fulfilling requirements, students
continue the study of a foreign language to a level as close as possible
to fluency. All majors should also make every effort to include a study
abroad program in their undergraduate education, preferably in their
sophomore or junior year.

Students must complete all General Education requirements. No courses
fulfilling major requirements may be taken Pass/Fail.

Special Opportunities in Global Studies
Honors in Global Studies
Honors study involves the completion of a substantial piece of original
research and the formal presentation of the results in an honors thesis
and oral defense. Those who successfully complete the program are
awarded their B.A. degree with either honors or highest honors in global
studies. Students who wish to submit a thesis for honors in global
studies must have at least a 3.3 cumulative grade point average and,
under normal circumstances, a 3.5 grade point average in the major and
must enroll in GLBL 691H and GLBL 692H. GLBL 692H may count toward
the major as a theme or area studies course with departmental approval.
GLBL 691H will count as elective credit only. Each prospective honors
student must submit a two- to three-page prospectus outlining his/her
project in the fall of the junior year. Students accepted into the global
studies honors program will enroll in GLBL 691H in the spring of the
junior year and GLBL 692H in the fall of the senior year.
Study Abroad (recommended, but optional)
Global studies majors are strongly urged to gain experiential knowledge
of the countries and thematic concerns they are studying through
participation in an approved study abroad program appropriate to their
areas of concentration. Every effort will be made by the curriculum to

University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill            551

integrate study abroad courses into the major. Students must receive
course approval from the director of undergraduate studies prior to
departure for a program abroad. No credit will be given unless programs
are preapproved.
Undergraduate Awards
All majors in the Curriculum in Global Studies who study abroad are
considered for two study abroad awards that are presented each year.
These funds may be used to defray any expenses associated with
studying abroad.

The Michael L. and Matthew L. Boyatt Award Fund provides several
meritorious awards each year of no more than $2,500 each. They are
designated for majors who want to participate in a study abroad program
pertinent to their area of concentration within global studies.

The Laura Hudson Richards Fund provides one award of $2,500 each year
to a major in the Curriculum in Global Studies who demonstrates both
academic excellence and financial need.

In addition, each spring the curriculum awards the Douglas Eyre Prize to
the student writing the best honors thesis. The curriculum also selects
an annual recipient of the Anne Scaff Award for service to the curriculum
and for internationalizing the College. Students chosen to receive the
Eyre Prize and Scaff Award are recognized at the curriculum’s spring
commencement ceremony.

Introduction

The study of history is an essential part of a liberal arts education
and offers valuable preparation for many careers: in law, journalism,
libraries, and museums; in local, state, and national public service; in
business; in international work; and, of course, in historical research
and teaching. More broadly, by an exposure to a variety of cultures and
human experience and by training in the interpretation of conflicting
evidence, the Department of History seeks to prepare a person for the
responsibilities of citizenship and for dealing with the ambiguities of
human existence. Diversity in the history major program encourages
a comparative approach to human problems and discourages
parochialism; specialization in the program promotes an appreciation
of the complexity of human affairs and the difficulties involved in
interpreting them. Finally, the discipline of history stimulates imagination
and analytical thinking.

Advising

All majors and minors have a primary academic advisor in Steele
Building. Students are strongly encouraged to meet regularly with
their advisors and review their Tar Heel Trackers each semester. The
Department of History offers students numerous advising resources to
assist them with all things related to studying history at UNC–Chapel
Hill, from making the initial decision to become a history major or
minor to thinking about what to do after they complete their degree.
Although history majors are not assigned individual faculty advisors,
they are strongly encouraged to seek out the advice of their professors
during office hours, especially if they are considering an independent
study project, senior honors thesis, or applying for graduate study. The
department’s lecturer/advisor serves as a general advising resource for
all history majors and minors as well as first- and second-year students
who are considering a major in history.

Graduate School and Career Opportunities

Most history majors at UNC–Chapel Hill develop careers that do not
involve practicing history in its narrow sense. These students work in a
range of fields: business, law, journalism, education, and government,
for example. These students have found that they can apply to many
different tasks the skills that history teaches: analyzing, conceptualizing,
investigating, researching, interpreting large amounts of information, as
well as communicating through writing and speaking.

Many history majors enter professional schools in a number of different
areas. Law school, business school, and medical school rank high in
popularity. By teaching students how to analyze problems, how to
understand society and human behavior, and how to communicate
effectively, a major in history provides excellent preparation for
enrollment in a professional school.

Some majors end up using history directly in their vocations. Those
who wish to teach history at the secondary level in public schools must
obtain appropriate certification, usually through an M.A.T. degree. Other
students pursue graduate study by entering a master’s degree program
in history that requires a thesis and takes about two years to complete. A
student can then decide whether to proceed into a Ph.D. program, which
normally requires an additional two years of study and the completion of
a doctoral dissertation. Students who decide to pursue a Ph.D. in history
generally teach at the college level. Some complete a master’s degree in
public history and work for government archives at the national, state,
or local levels or for private nonprofit organizations, such as groups
interested in restoration work.

and GPA restrictions may apply.

History Major, NUS Joint Degree

History majors may wish to consider applying for the Joint Degree
Program, an innovative undergraduate degree program joining UNC–
Chapel Hill and the National University of Singapore, one of the top
universities in Asia and the world. UNC–Chapel Hill undergraduates
spend from two to four semesters at the National University of Singapore
and receive a joint bachelor of arts degree with a major in history from
both institutions. For further information about the Joint Degree Program,
see the department Web site (http://history.unc.edu/undergraduate-
program/joint-degree-program-with-the-national-university-of-singapore)
or contact the Study Abroad Office and the director of undergraduate
studies in the Department of History.

Special Opportunities in History
Honors in History
The departmental honors program is open to any qualified history
major with at least a 3.3 cumulative grade point average and, under
normal circumstances, a 3.4 in history courses, and experience in

University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill            585

research and writing derived from an undergraduate seminar in history
(HIST 398). The student pursuing a degree in history with honors must
take HIST 691H and HIST 692H; these two courses contribute credit
hours toward fulfilling field-of-concentration requirements, depending
on the topic of the thesis. The student, in consultation with the honors
director, will choose a topic and locate an appropriate faculty member
to supervise a senior honors thesis. In HIST 691H the mechanics of
researching and writing a senior essay will be discussed and a start made
on the essay itself. In HIST 692H the essay will be completed and the
student examined by the supervisor and at least one additional faculty
member to be agreed upon by the student and supervisor. To receive
highest honors the essay must be recommended by the examiners and
a review committee. The director of honors, in consultation with the
examiners and review committee, will recommend that the student who
has defended the essay graduate with either honors or highest honors,
or merely with course credit. Students should submit applications for
the honors program by the end of February during their junior year. For
detailed guidelines click here (http://history.unc.edu/undergraduate-
program/senior-honors-thesis) or contact the director of honors in the
Department of History.
Departmental Involvement
Students with broad interests in the intellectual and social life of the
department may volunteer to serve on the department’s Undergraduate
Studies Committee (UGSC). Each spring the department invites majors to
volunteer for the UGSC, and the selection is made at the start of the next
fall semester by the faculty members on the UGSC. Students may also
plan or participate in activities organized by the Undergraduate History
Club as well as, for those who are eligible, UNC–Chapel Hill’s chapter
of Phi Alpha Theta (described more fully below under “Undergraduate
Awards”). For more information about the UGSC, the History Club, and
Phi Alpha Theta, see department’s Web site or contact the coordinator for
undergraduate studies in the Department of History.
Experiential Education
In some cases, students majoring in history may wish to pursue
internship opportunities. Questions and requests regarding internships
should be directed to the department’s lecturer/advisor, who has
responsibility for evaluating internship proposals and deciding whether
an internship may be taken for academic credit. For more information,
click here (http://history.unc.edu/undergraduate-program/internship-
opportunities-for-history-majors).

All history majors will receive credit for the experiential education (EE)
General Education requirement when they complete HIST 398.
Study Abroad
The department strongly encourages its students to explore the many
study abroad opportunities provided by the Study Abroad Office. The
experience of studying abroad opens intellectual horizons that can be
glimpsed only in unfamiliar worlds, and it deepens one’s appreciation for
the enduring power of historical context and circumstance.

The Department of History participates in a unique joint degree program
with the National University of Singapore. The department also has an
exchange program with King’s College in London. For further information
about both programs, contact the Study Abroad Office and the director of
undergraduate studies in the department. General information for history
majors wishing to study abroad can be found on the department's Web
site (http://history.unc.edu/undergraduate-program/study-abroad).

586         History Minor

Undergraduate Awards
All majors who complete the required undergraduate seminar (HIST 398)
are automatically eligible for the annual Joshua Meador Prize, awarded
to the author of the best seminar paper written in the preceding calendar
year. A named prize is also awarded to the author of the best honors
thesis; the award is announced at the annual spring honors banquet.

The Department of History sponsors a chapter of Phi Alpha Theta, the
national history honor society. Students who have taken 12 hours of
history courses at UNC–Chapel Hill and who have an overall grade point
average of 3.0 and an average in history courses of 3.1 are eligible to
apply for membership. An announcement regarding applications for Phi
Alpha Theta will be distributed to all history majors in the fall semester.
Undergraduate Research
The Department of History encourages undergraduate research in a
variety of ways. The required seminar for majors (HIST 398) introduces
students to historical research. The senior honors program (HIST 691H
and HIST 692H) gives students an opportunity to carry out a yearlong
research project. In both the fall and spring semesters, senior honors
students may apply for competitive awards, including the Michael L. and
Matthew L. Boyatt Awards in History for Undergraduate Research and
the David Anthony Kusa Undergraduate Research Award, to help support
travel for the purpose of research.

JAMES THOMPSON, Program Director

Introduction

Students interested in an interdisciplinary degree program not covered
by any degree-granting department or curriculum should apply to the
program director for interdisciplinary studies.

In the past, students have designed their own majors in such varied fields
as medieval studies, food studies, arts management, medical geography,
healthcare policy, medical humanities, cultural studies, behavioral
finance, urban studies, documentary studies, computational physics, and
enthnobotany.

Advising

Appointments may be made with James Thompson. Inquiries may be
made through e-mail (uthomp@email.unc.edu). Students should come
prepared with a draft of their major proposal. Students are strongly
encouraged to meet regularly with their advisor and review their Tar Heel
Tracker each semester.

Graduate School and Career Opportunities

Since IDST can provide a broad background in the liberal arts, graduate
study in a number of academic disciplines is possible. Students are
encouraged to contact the graduate or professional school to which
they wish to gain admission to determine the specific undergraduate
academic requirements necessary for admission. An IDST major is
generally not recommended for students planning graduate study in the
sciences, but many students combine majors aimed at medical, legal, or
business careers with an IDST major.

Career opportunities for IDST majors are as varied as the reasons
students give for selecting the major.

The degree program consists of eight courses, which must be chosen
from at least three departments (with a maximum of four courses from
any one department) and which must be appropriate for juniors and
seniors majoring in those departments. The courses should form a
coherent major to which the student is able to assign a title. Additionally,
students are encouraged to select electives and General Education
courses that complement the eight courses chosen for the major.

With the permission of the relevant professional school, a student
may use up to 12 hours of professional courses (e.g., in business
administration, media and journalism, information and library science,
public health, education) in the IDST major. This can be advantageous to
students who want some concentration in these areas but who also want
a degree in arts and sciences.

Special Opportunities in Interdisciplinary
Studies

Qualified students may pursue honors through one of the departments or
curricula included in their major core.

IDST students may participate in the undergraduate research
opportunities available in the departments and curricula that constitute
their program of study; they sometimes complete an internship either in
the summer or during the academic year, and an honors thesis in their
senior year.

Professor James Thompson, Program Director

The interdisciplinary studies major, designed by the student and the
student’s faculty sponsor, is for students who wish to develop a major
outside those offered by the departments and curricula belonging to the
College of Arts and Sciences.

An IDST major has more focus than many of the more traditional majors
and therefore should not be seen as a default major for someone
undecided about his or her course of study. The IDST major must be
well conceived but substantially different from majors that students
pursue through traditional departments, schools, and curricula. Students
must have a grade point average of at least 2.75 and at least 45 hours
left before graduation so that they can complete the major in their time
left. All IDST students must identify a faculty sponsor who will serve as
their mentor on course selections, career planning, graduate work, and
advanced study. Students are strongly encouraged to meet all of the
General Education Foundations and Approaches requirements before
pursuing the interdisciplinary studies major.

Requirements 

In addition to the program requirements listed below, students must

• attain a final cumulative GPA of at least 2.0
• complete a minimum of 45 academic credit hours earned from UNC-

Chapel Hill courses

• take at least half of their major course requirements (courses and

credit hours) at UNC-Chapel Hill

• earn a minimum of 18 hours of C or better in the major core

requirements (some majors require 21 hours).

For more information, please consult the degree requirements section of
the catalog (p. 92).

Introduction

The three main goals of the Curriculum in Latin American Studies are

1. to develop students’ basic knowledge and comprehension of key

themes in Latin American and Caribbean history, cultures, and
contemporary social, economic, and political issues

2. to develop students’ abilities to think critically, in an interdisciplinary

manner, about Latin American and Caribbean issues, past and
present, and to locate them within broader global perspectives

3. to develop students’ proficiency in Spanish or Portuguese and other
languages of the region as needed, as part of their program of study.

Advising

All majors have a primary academic advisor in Steele Building. Students
are strongly encouraged to meet regularly with their advisor and review
their Tar Heel Tracker each semester. The department’s director of
undergraduate studies (DUS) works with current and prospective majors
by appointment. Majors are expected to meet with the LTAM DUS once
a semester and to attend at least one meeting of the LTAM majors
a year. Departmental academic advising is particularly important for
those majors who are considering going on to graduate school. Further
information on courses, undergraduate research and internship funding
opportunities, and the honors program may be obtained through the
Curriculum in Latin American Studies Web page (http://isa.unc.edu)
or by contacting the director of undergraduate studies (see "Contact
Information" above).

Graduate School and Career Opportunities

The Curriculum in Latin American Studies provides advice for students
interested in pursuing graduate school and career opportunities in Latin
America or the Caribbean. Please contact the director of undergraduate
studies for an appointment. The Curriculum in Latin American Studies
participates in a five-year cooperative B.A.–M.A. program with the Center
for Latin American Studies at Georgetown University. The agreement
allows qualified Latin American studies majors to earn an M.A. in Latin
American studies from Georgetown in a year and a summer rather than
the normal three to four semesters. For details on the cooperative degree
program (http://isa.unc.edu/academics/undergraduate) contact the
director of undergraduate studies.

The Curriculum in Latin American Studies is divided into two
concentrations: humanities and social sciences. These concentrations
are further divided into sequences: humanities, into history and culture-
literature sequences; social sciences, into journalism-political science
and anthropology-economics-geography sequences. To ensure depth
in a single discipline of Latin American and Caribbean studies, four of
the 10 courses required for the major must be selected from one of
the sequences. To ensure breadth of exposure to other areas of Latin
American and Caribbean studies, two courses must be selected from
each of the other three sequences.

Special Opportunities in Latin American
Studies
Honors in Latin American Studies
Latin American studies majors with an overall grade point average of
3.3 are invited to pursue a degree with honors by writing an honors
thesis during the senior year. Each honors thesis is written under the
direction of an appropriate faculty advisor; when completed, the thesis
must be defended orally before an examining board of faculty members.
Honors candidates enroll in the two honors courses (LTAM 691H
and LTAM 692H). LTAM 691H counts as a course in the student’s
concentration.
Experiential Education
Students who are particularly committed to field experience or
experiential education in Latin America may be able to arrange for this
through independent study credit. Students wishing to do so should
have the academic support of a regular faculty member and contact the
institute’s associate director well in advance of the semester in which the
experience is to take place.
Intensive Yucatec Maya
Each summer the Consortium in Latin American and Caribbean Studies
at the University of North Carolina and Duke University offers intensive
instruction in modern Yucatec Maya, with a secondary focus on ancient,
colonial, and modern Maya culture. The courses include classroom
instruction in Chapel Hill (LTAM 411) or in Mérida, Mexico (LTAM 512
and LTAM 690), and a field study experience in Yucatán, Mexico. See the

596         Latin American Studies Major, B.A.

Maya program (http://isa.unc.edu/language-programs/yucatec-maya-
institute) Web site for current course information.
Independent Study
Any student may enroll in independent study (LTAM 396) with the
permission of the curriculum faculty advisor and the agreement of a Latin
American or Caribbean studies faculty member who will supervise the
student’s independent study project. This course may be used to fulfill
the requirements of the major, and it is often linked to internships or to
undergraduate grants for summer research travel.
Study Abroad
Study abroad is not a requirement of the major; however, living and
studying in Latin America or the Caribbean is highly recommended as
an experience that majors should consider. The UNC–Chapel Hill Study
Abroad Office offers a broad range of programs in Latin America and the
Caribbean. Visit the Study Abroad Office Web site at studyabroad.unc.edu
(http://studyabroad.unc.edu). ISA and the Study Abroad Office offer
competitive scholarships for majors wishing to undertake study in Latin
America and the Caribbean.
Undergraduate Awards
Each year UNC–Chapel Hill offers funding opportunities for students
conducting research or studying abroad in Latin America or the
Caribbean. These include the Julia Crane, Halpern, and Mellon Awards.
The Federico Gil award recognizes the best undergraduate honors thesis
written on a Latin American or Caribbean topic. Contact the director of
undergraduate studies for information.
Undergraduate Research
Latin American Studies majors are eligible to develop a senior thesis
project in their last year. The thesis may be related to a field work project
the summer after the junior year. A small number of grants might be
available for undergraduate field research in Latin America, especially in
connection with a senior thesis.

Introduction

Courses in the department are offered for the general student and for
those who wish to receive the bachelor of arts with a major in linguistics.
Courses in linguistics are intended to open up systematic perspectives on
the nature of human language by means of detailed studies of language
structure, language change and language acquisition, the sound system
of language, and the syntactic/semantic system of language. The
major is designed to provide a fundamental understanding of modern
linguistics for the student seeking a general education in the liberal arts
as well as for the student preparing for graduate study.

Advising

All majors and minors have a primary academic advisor in Steele
Building. Students are strongly encouraged to meet regularly with
their advisor and review their Tar Heel Tracker each semester. The
department’s director of undergraduate studies works with current and
prospective majors and minors by appointment. Departmental academic
advising is particularly important for those majors who are considering
going on to graduate school or who are considering the dual B.A.–M.A.
program.

Graduate School and Career Opportunities

The Department of Linguistics offers an M.A. program with opportunities
for specialization in a number of subareas. Detailed information is
available from the department Web site. Additionally, more than 100
colleges and universities offer linguistics programs, including several
dozen that are considered major programs nationally. Faculty members
are pleased to advise students regarding programs best suited to their
needs and interests.

In general, the linguistics major is good preparation for a number
of career paths because it develops problem solving, the ability to
find patterns in complicated data, and writing and argumentation
skills. Law and journalism schools and other professional schools are
becoming increasingly aware that students with a major in linguistics
have strengths in these important areas. United States citizens with
a background in linguistics also may find jobs with United States
government agencies.

Some students choose to continue specializing in linguistics teaching
or research. For this, they typically need to obtain a graduate degree
in linguistics. Other possible careers for linguistics majors that have a
close connection to language and linguistics include language teaching,
speech pathology/speech and hearing science, language and information
technologies (including speech synthesis and recognition, text-content
analysis, and machine translation), information and library science,

of LING 200, LING 530 instead of LING 201, LING 525 instead of
LING 202 or LING 528 instead of LING 203. Credit will not be granted
for both the 200 level course and its graduate level counterpart
noted here. However, students may receive credit for both courses
in the pairs noted above (LING 200/LING 520; LING 201/LING 537;
LING 202/LING 541; LING 203/LING 540), one as a core class and the
other as an elective.

Thus, the major requires eight courses, including LING 101. Students
majoring in linguistics may concentrate entirely in linguistics, or they
may select their major courses to include a field related to linguistics,
such as linguistic anthropology, computer processing of language
data, philosophy of language, psychology of language, sociology of
language, speech and hearing sciences, or study of a particular language
or language family. Any such second-field option should be planned in
consultation with the student’s advisor. Students interested in a career
in speech pathology may pursue a minor in speech and hearing sciences
through the Division of Speech and Hearing Sciences in the UNC School
of Medicine.

Although it emphasizes graduate training, the department offers basic
coursework, opportunities for supervised practical experience, and an
academic minor to all advanced undergraduates. The minor is designed
to allow students access to departmental courses, facilities, and advisors
in order to develop marine specializations related to their majors and
to prepare for postgraduate study in marine sciences or a related field.
Introductory courses also are offered for all undergraduates who are
interested in marine sciences.

Advising

The director of undergraduate studies advises students on selecting
appropriate coursework in marine sciences, reviews progress toward
completion of the minor, and assists in approving equivalent courses. All
current and prospective minors are strongly encouraged to meet with the
director of undergraduate studies prior to declaring their minor.

Facilities

Research laboratories are equipped for general studies in marine
sciences and the special research interests of faculty and students.
The Institute of Marine Sciences, located in Morehead City, NC, houses
laboratory buildings with dock and ocean access. The Institute operates
a modern 48-foot coastal vessel, the R.V. Capricorn, and a fleet of
outboard-powered boats.

Introduction

Mathematics has always been a fundamental component of human
thought and culture, and the growth of technology in recent times has
further increased its importance. UNC–Chapel Hill offers several degrees
in mathematics and the mathematical sciences, providing students a
choice of careers in this field. Among the jobs in industry, government,
and the academic world that involve mathematics are actuary, analyst,
modeler, optimizer, statistician, and computer analyst.

Students intending to teach mathematics in elementary and middle
school and students enrolled in the School of Education who intend to
major in mathematics should consult the School of Education section of
the Catalog or the director of mathematical education in the Department
of Mathematics. A section below suggests course selections for future
high school teachers.

Advising

All majors and minors have a primary academic advisor in Steele
Building. Students should regularly meet with their advisors and review
their Tar Heel Trackers to be sure that they are satisfying distribution and
degree requirements. In addition, junior and senior majors are assigned
each semester a mathematics faculty member as an advisor with whom
they must meet to discuss course selections and any other questions
before a hold on registration is lifted. The department’s director of
undergraduate studies and assistant (see contact information above)
are also available by appointment. Further information on courses,
undergraduate research opportunities, the honors program, careers,
and graduate schools may be obtained from the department’s Web site
(http://www.math.unc.edu).

Placement into Mathematics Courses

Standardized test scores such as the Advanced Placement (AP),
Scholastic Achievement Test Subject Levels I or II (SAT), or the American
College Test (ACT) can be used for placement into mathematics courses.
Please visit the placement page (http://math.unc.edu/for-undergrads/
placement-info) of the department’s Web site for specific information
regarding placement.

Graduate School and Career Opportunities

The B.S. degree program, especially if it includes the sequences
MATH 521–MATH 522 and MATH 577–MATH 578, is excellent
preparation for graduate study in the mathematical sciences. The B.A.
degree can be excellent preparation for graduate study in many fields,
including admission into professional schools of law, business, and

medicine. Both degrees are viewed by many employers as attractive,
especially when accompanied by electives in areas such as statistics,
computer science, economics, and operations research. Undergraduate
mathematics majors with critical thinking skills and good analytical
abilities are in demand in many business, industry, and government
fields.

Special Opportunities in Mathematics

Special activities for qualified students include an undergraduate
Mathematics Club, problem-solving seminars, the Putnam Mathematical
Competition, and the Virginia Tech Mathematics Contest. Students
interested in these activities should consult the departmental honors
advisor.

Qualified undergraduate students may work as research assistants in
the Fluid Laboratory or as tutors in the Math Help Center. Students can
conduct original research with the guidance of a faculty member, usually
in conjunction with the preparation of an honors project. Study Abroad
opportunities include semester or yearlong programs in a variety of
countries. The Archibald Henderson Medal and the Alfred Brauer Prize
recognize outstanding performance and promise in mathematics.

Undergraduate honors research projects as well as some internships or
study abroad programs might qualify for experiential education credit.
MATH 290, MATH 396, and MATH 410 satisfy this requirement.
Honors in Mathematics
Special honors (H) sections are given in some mathematics courses
when student demand is sufficient (for example, MATH 62H, MATH 233H,
MATH 383H).

Promising students are encouraged to work toward a bachelor’s degree
with honors in mathematics. This program consists of six or more
courses approved by the departmental honors advisor and satisfactory
completion of an honors project completed over the two semesters of
the senior year. The honors project is conducted in association with a
departmental faculty member on a topic approved by the departmental
honors advisor, and spans two semesters of independent research,
during which time the honors candidate must be enrolled in MATH 691H
and MATH 692H. The final report on the project includes both a written
description and an oral presentation before a committee of three faculty
(including the project advisor) approved by the departmental honors
advisor. The committee will then report to the departmental honors

Mathematics has always been a fundamental component of human
thought and culture, and the growth of technology in recent times has
further increased its importance.

Students majoring in mathematics may enter either the B.A. or the B.S.
program. The B.S. program is more comprehensive; it provides solid
preparation for work or for further study in mathematics and related
fields. Within the B.S. program there is an applied option, which is
designed for students who are primarily interested in using mathematics
for the study of other sciences.

Introduction

The United States Army Reserve Officers’ Training Corps (AROTC)
provides unrivalled leadership training for success in any career
field. AROTC offers students the opportunity to study, develop, and
demonstrate leadership and mission command. Those who successfully
complete the program are commissioned as second lieutenants in
the United States Army. Army ROTC offers a variety of leadership
experiences, academic challenges, and unique learning opportunities—
unlike any other University program or department.

The Army ROTC Program
Four-Year Program
Students enrolled in the four-year program take courses during each
semester. The first two years include the ROTC basic course and
concentrate on leadership development, ethics and values, the profession
of arms, and basic military skills. Starting the junior year, cadets enter
the ROTC advanced course. The advanced course curriculum focuses
on the study and application of leadership skills, mission command,
advanced land navigation, and military history. Qualified cadets will have
the opportunity to attend multiple iterations of Cadet Summer Training
at Fort Knox, Kentucky. In their senior year, cadets submit accessions
packets—including component (Active, Reserve, National Guard) and
branch preferences—to compete for the opportunity to serve the nation
as commissioned officers.
Two-Year Program
The two-year program provides an opportunity for students to meet
the requirements for the advanced course program and potential
commissioning as officers in the United States Army. To be eligible
for consideration, a student must have previously served in the armed
services or attended Cadet Initial Entry Training at Fort Knox, Kentucky.
Interested Students
Students seeking to learn more about themselves, leadership, and the
United States Army can take ARMY 101, ARMY 102, ARMY 201, and
ARMY 202 without incurring a service obligation.

Advising

Cadets are required to complete an additional academic tracking form
and receive guidance from their military science instructor to ensure
military and graduation requirements are met.

Introduction

The Department of Music provides many opportunities to students who
wish to study music within a strong liberal arts curriculum. We foster
creative endeavor and critical inquiry through courses, ensembles, and
lessons on instruments or voice that explore music from a variety of
perspectives. The department offers both the bachelor of arts (B.A.)
and the bachelor of music (B.Mus.) degrees for students majoring in
music, and a minor in music for students majoring in other fields. The
department also offers many courses and performance opportunities to
undergraduates majoring in fields other than music.

Admission

B.Mus. students whose primary focus is composition (and whether or not
choosing an emphasis in composition) will fulfill the Individual Lessons
core requirement by taking MUSC 166, three semesters of MUSC 266, and
two hours of MUSC 100–MUSC 107 or MUSC 200–MUSC 207.

MUSC 100–MUSC 107 may be repeated for credit to a maximum of eight
hours; MUSC 200–MUSC 207 may be repeated for credit to a maximum
of 16 hours; MUSC 266 may be repeated for credit to a maximum of 18
hours; MUSC 300–MUSC 306 may be repeated for credit for a degree to a
maximum of six hours.

Ensembles

A variety of department ensembles under MUSC 211–MUSC 214 are open
to all students by audition. Each carries one credit hour per semester and
may be repeated for credit.

B.A. candidates majoring in music must accrue four credit hours
in ensembles drawn from MUSC 211 and/or MUSC 212. B.Mus.
candidates must accrue eight credit hours chosen from MUSC 211 and/
or MUSC 212, at least five of which must be from MUSC 211.

B.A. candidates majoring in music may count no more than three
additional hours from MUSC 211–MUSC 214 towards their degree for
music or general elective credit; candidates for the B.Mus. may count no
more than six additional hours from MUSC 211–MUSC 214 towards their
degree for music or general elective credit.

B.A. students whose primary instrument is piano will normally fulfill
the ensemble requirement by taking one semester of large ensemble
(MUSC 211) in addition to the three-semester piano ensemble sequence
(Piano Ensemble I: Piano Duet; Piano Ensemble II: Vocal Accompanying;
Piano Ensemble II: Instrumental Accompanying).

Students are admitted to the B.A. or B.Mus. programs through the regular
admissions process established by the University. Prospective students
intending to major in music are urged to contact the Department of Music
for an audition during the year prior to their anticipated enrollment in
order to strengthen their application credentials and to compete for
scholarships offered by the department, including the prestigious William
R. Kenan Jr. Music Scholarship.

B.Mus. students whose primary instrument is piano will normally take
at least one semester of large ensemble (MUSC 211) and the three-
semester piano ensemble sequence (Piano Ensemble I: Piano Duet;
Piano Ensemble II: Vocal Accompanying; Piano Ensemble II: Instrumental
Accompanying). The rest of the ensemble requirement will be fulfilled
by way of additional semesters of MUSC 211 (which may include
Collaborative Piano) or MUSC 214.

Individual and Group Lessons

Instruction for academic credit in keyboard, woodwind, brass, percussion,
string instruments, and in voice is available to all University students. All
lessons are normally offered each semester and are subject to admission
and other requirements being met. Group lessons may also be available
on selected instruments and in voice.

Studio assignments are based on instructor availability with preference
given to music majors (B.A. and B.Mus.). Fees are charged for lessons
based on an annual schedule published by the department. Music lesson
fees are to be paid during the registration period; if fees remain unpaid,
lessons will be discontinued.

All students wishing to enroll for lessons must first gain the permission
of the appropriate area head to register (see the Department of Music’s
Web site (http://music.unc.edu/undergraduate/lessons) for current
information); this will involve an audition. Once permission has been
granted, the registration process is handled by the Department of Music’s
registrar, who is also responsible for procedures leading to billing and the
formal assignment to a teacher.

Students should check with the appropriate ensemble director for more
information concerning requirements and procedures for the auditions,
which are typically held during the first week of each semester. Ensemble
directors are listed on the department's Web site (http://music.unc.edu/
undergraduate/ensembles). The department offers the following
ensembles, most of which meet the ensemble or elective requirements
for the music major:

studies work with current and prospective music majors individually by
appointment (see “Contact Information” above). Further information on

Introduction

The purpose of the NROTC is to provide a source of highly qualified
officers to serve on United States Navy ships, submarines, and aircraft,
or in the United States Marine Corps. Students (midshipmen) who
obtain a baccalaureate degree and who satisfy academic and physical
requirements are commissioned as either ensigns in the Navy or
second lieutenants in the Marine Corps. Students may participate in
NROTC in one of two programs: the NROTC Scholarship Program or the
NROTC College Program. NROTC scholarships provide tuition, books,
fees, uniforms, and a monthly allowance of $250 to $400. Students
participating in the college program receive their NROTC books, uniforms,
and a monthly allowance of $350 to $400 during their junior and senior
years. A major advantage of the college program is the excellent
opportunity it offers to win two- and three-year NROTC scholarships.

Regardless of enrollment category, many features are common to both
programs:

• Naval science courses carry academic credit.
• All students are welcome to join the program and “test the waters”

without immediately incurring a military obligation.

• All midshipmen who successfully complete the program and

graduation requirements receive commissions as officers in the Navy
or Marine Corps.

• Applicants are considered without regard to race, sex, creed, or

religion.

Midshipman Life

We are dedicated to ensuring that each midshipman leads a full and
productive University life. Midshipmen are encouraged to participate
on University athletic teams as well as in campus politics, fraternities,
sororities, intramurals, and other organizations. Additionally, midshipmen
are provided an outstanding opportunity to examine and experience many
alternative career paths, social events, and experiences through field
trips, summer cruises, and the midshipman military organization.

NROTC Program

Courses offered by the Department of Naval Science, in conjunction
with courses offered in the Curriculum in Peace, War, and Defense, are
designed to equip an individual with the necessary tools to succeed as an
officer in the naval service.

Information about applications and admissions in the UNC–Chapel Hill
Naval ROTC may be obtained by visiting the Naval Armory on campus; by
addressing an inquiry to Professor of Naval Science, CB# 3325, University

Dual Bachelor’s–Master’s Degree Program

The Department of Nutrition offers a B.S.P.H.–M.S. dual degree for
students who wish to increase their knowledge in nutrition and acquire
additional skills in nutrition-based research. This dual degree will be
useful for students interested in becoming researchers in industry,
program officers for nongovernmental and governmental organizations,
project or laboratory managers in academic or nonacademic settings,
international workers in nutrition-related programs, and graduate

Frank Porter Graham Honor Society, Phi Beta Kappa, and the Joseph
Edozien Outstanding Undergraduate Award in Nutrition.
Undergraduate Research
To enhance students’ general education and help them decide whether
a research career is something they might pursue, all B.S.P.H. nutrition
students are required to complete nutrition research, either as part of the
honors thesis or as independent research.

students pursuing a doctoral degree or eventually attending medical
or another professional school. B.S.P.H.–M.S students will perform
advanced research in nutrition and take graduate nutrition and other
courses that will provide the information and experience needed to help
them choose their career path. Additionally, for those students who are
uncertain about whether they wish to enter the department’s doctoral
program, the B.S.P.H.–M.S program offers an excellent opportunity to
determine whether a more advanced degree would be appropriate. The
B.S.P.H.–M.S degree is not specific to any of the department divisions;
rather, it builds on the work (both classroom-based and research) begun
in the B.S.P.H. program. In summary, the B.S.P.H.–M.S program in
nutrition allows students the opportunity to explore nutritional research
at an advanced level. The program can be completed in one calendar year
(summer, fall, spring) following completion of the B.S.P.H. in nutrition
program.

Nutrition B.S.P.H. students interested in the dual-degree program are
strongly advised to consult their research advisor and the director of
undergraduate studies in nutrition during their sophomore year to discuss
eligibility and an appropriate plan of study. For more information see the
B.S.P.H.–M.S Dual Degree Nutrition Handbook (http://www.sph.unc.edu/
nutr/degrees).

Special Opportunities in Nutrition
Honors in Nutrition
The Department of Nutrition provides an opportunity for honors study for
qualified students. To be eligible for admission to the honors program
students must have, at a minimum, a cumulative grade point average
of 3.3 at the beginning of their senior year and must maintain the grade
point average throughout the major if they intend to pursue honors.
Students register for NUTR 295 (three credits) every semester and
then enroll in NUTR 692H (three credits) in their final semester while
completing an honors thesis in nutrition.
Departmental Involvement
The Nutrition Coalition (http://studentlife.unc.edu/organization/
nutritioncoalition) is an organization of students enrolled in one of
the department’s five degree programs. The coalition meets several
times each semester to address student concerns and to plan service
and social activities. Open to the entire University, the coalition strives
to broaden the scope of understanding of the various fields and
environments in which nutrition is making advances. “A is for Apple” is
a student-led, volunteer organization aimed at teaching basic nutrition
principles to local elementary school students. Career development
workshops are available each year to provide guidance for students
applying to graduate and medical schools.
Experiential Education
Two courses in nutrition include experiential components (NUTR 245 and
NUTR 295). However, NUTR 295, available only to nutrition majors, fulfills
the General Education experiential education requirement.
Undergraduate Awards
Nutrition honors research students may apply for the honors
undergraduate research awards. The application is available on the
Honors Carolina (http://honorscarolina.unc.edu) Web site. Students also
may be considered for any of the following awards: Chancellor’s Awards

Introduction

Pathology is the study of disease, its causes, development, and
consequences. It is concerned with basic mechanisms of disease
processes (pathobiology) and their structural/functional manifestations.
Pathology combines the tools and the basic knowledge from many
disciplines, such as molecular biology, cell biology, biochemistry,
genetics, immunology, anatomy, and clinical sciences, to clarify the
cause (etiology), natural course (pathogenesis), and diagnosis of
disease. The department offers several pathology courses appropriate for
undergraduate study.

In addition to formal courses, faculty members in the Department of
Pathology and Laboratory Medicine of the UNC School of Medicine
maintain active research programs and engage in training predoctoral
students and postdoctoral fellows in a range of research endeavors.
Undergraduate students interested in participating in a hands-on
research experience should contact the director of graduate studies in
pathology for more information. Contact information is available on the
department’s Web site.

Introduction

Peace and war are among the oldest dreams and most difficult
challenges of human experience. The curriculum brings together faculty
and courses from many disciplines to provide undergraduates with
a range of approaches to the fundamental issues of human conflict
and national and global security and defense. The curriculum prepares
majors for graduate work in several of the humanities and social
sciences, for a variety of professional schools, and for a range of
employment. Graduates have found employment with federal agencies,
state and local governments, banks, and other businesses. Others have
attended graduate and professional schools in government, history,
international relations, and law. The strength of the curriculum is its
broad interdisciplinary perspective combined with its depth of focus on
topics that span the range of human experience across time and national
boundaries, from science and technology to ethics and public policy. In
addition to coursework, the curriculum sponsors guest speakers and field
trips, and provides majors with help and advice on internships and career
planning.

Advising

All majors have a primary academic advisor in Steele Building. Students
are strongly encouraged to meet regularly with their advisor and review
their Tar Heel Tracker each semester. The curriculum’s student services
manager and the chair work with current and prospective majors by
appointment (see contact information above). Further information on
courses, internships, the honors program, careers, and graduate schools
may be obtained from the curriculum’s Web site (http://www.unc.edu/
depts/pwad).

Graduate School and Career Opportunities

The curriculum prepares majors for graduate work in several of the
humanities and social sciences, for a variety of professional schools, and
for a range of employment. Graduates work for federal agencies, state
and local governments, nongovernmental organizations, businesses,

thesis director by the end of the junior year. Students prepare an honors
thesis in PWAD 691H and PWAD 692H and defend it orally. PWAD 691H
can be used to fulfill the student’s chosen concentration requirement;
PWAD 692H provides credit hours toward the major but cannot be used
to satisfy concentration requirements. Based on faculty evaluations,
the baccalaureate degree may be conferred with honors or with highest
honors, or merely with course credit.
Departmental Involvement
Undergraduates can participate in the activities and programs of
the Triangle Institute for Security Studies at no cost by becoming a
Wickersham Scholar. To become a scholar, a student must have a faculty
sponsor and a demonstrated interest in international security studies.
For more information contact Carolyn Pumphrey at (919) 613-9280 or
pumphrey@duke.edu.
Experiential Education
Internship courses provide students with the opportunity to earn
academic credit while obtaining practical work experience in agencies
and organizations clearly related to national and international security.
In recent years students have served in these and other agencies: The
Central Intelligence Agency, Durham Police Department, Office of Naval
Intelligence, Defense Intelligence Agency, Carolina for Kibera, Center for
Strategic and International Studies, Peace Action, United States Army
Special Operations Command, and many more. Students are limited to
one internship for credit, and all internships are limited to three hours
of academic credit. Although some routine administrative tasks are
required in any professional setting, the expectation is that a majority of
the intern’s work will be directed toward the substantive mission of the
agency and that tasks will be of a nature to justify awarding academic
credit. All internships require prior approval, and all must consist of
at least eight hours per week and at least 100 hours per semester.
Students must sign an internship contract with their agency and faculty
supervisors, setting out expectations and course requirements. Interns
are required to keep a daily internship journal. Once approved for an
internship, students enroll in PWAD 393, which is offered on a Pass/
Fail basis only and does not count toward the nine courses required
for the major. Students wishing credit towards the major derived from
their internship work should pursue an independent study with a faculty
supervisor either while taking the internship or in the next semester. That
independent study should produce a major written product, would be
graded normally, and receives credit in the major.
Study Abroad
The curriculum encourages all undergraduates to study abroad either
for a summer, a semester, or an entire year. Students should consult the
study abroad (http://studyabroad.unc.edu) Web site and visit the Study
Abroad Office as early as possible in their course of study to meet with
a study abroad advisor. A number of foreign programs contain courses
that qualify for major credit. Of particular usefulness is study at the
King’s College, University of London War Studies Department, the closest
analogue to the Curriculum in Peace, War, and Defense in the English-
speaking world and a program with a renowned faculty. Students with
at least a 3.3 grade point average are eligible to apply to King’s College.
While supervision arrangements need to be negotiated and agreed with
relevant faculty members, students writing honors theses in their senior
year may also apply to spend the year at King’s College.
Undergraduate Research
Students who qualify are encouraged to experience original research by
writing a senior honors thesis described in the honors section above.

Introduction

The principal goal of the study of philosophy is to enable students
to think more clearly, deeply, and appreciatively about themselves
and their world. Study of philosophy enhances analytical, critical, and
interpretive capacities that are applicable to any subject matter in almost
any context. It provides many opportunities for expressing oneself, for
reflecting on questions that human beings have pondered for millennia,
for exchanging reasoned beliefs and engaging in focused debate, and for
learning how to come to terms with problems for which there are no easy
answers. A good philosophical education also helps to prepare students
for responsible and intelligent participation in political and community
affairs.

The most important outcome of philosophical study is the ability to
engage in thinking that is at once disciplined and imaginatively creative.
While such thinking lies at the heart of the philosophical enterprise,
it is also needed for success in any complex intellectual or practical
endeavor. Philosophy’s attention to critical thought, rigorous argument,
and articulate expression makes the philosophical curriculum absolutely
central to a liberal education and valuable as a basis for further training in
a variety of pursuits.

Examples of philosophical questions are

• How should we understand truth, existence, validity, fact, value, free

will?

• What are the principles or presuppositions of science, language,

political systems, religious and moral views?

• What is the nature of a person, of space and time, of a work of art?
• What is the wisdom of the past on these enduring questions? How

can we learn from people such as Plato, Aristotle, Descartes, and
Kant?

Students are encouraged to view philosophy not as a specialized,
esoteric discipline, but instead as an activity integral to a liberal arts
education, helping students to think more cogently and appreciatively
about themselves and their world.

PHIL 101, PHIL 110, or PHIL 112 is recommended as a first course for
those interested in philosophical issues and their cultural significance
and for those who wish to examine a broad range of philosophical topics,
problems, or historical figures. Other good starting points are PHIL 155,
which deals with logic and the analysis of argument; PHIL 160, which
deals with moral thought and experience; and PHIL 150, which deals with
the concepts, methods, and foundations of the biological and physical
sciences.

University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill            667

PHIL 155 is recommended for all students who major or minor in
philosophy.

Advising

All majors and minors have a primary academic advisor in Steele
Building. Students are strongly encouraged to meet regularly with
their advisor and review their Tar Heel Tracker each semester. The
department’s director of undergraduate studies works with current
and prospective majors by appointment (see contact information
above). Departmental academic advising is particularly important for
those majors who are considering going on to graduate school. Further
information on courses, undergraduate research opportunities, the
honors program, careers, and graduate schools may be obtained from the
department’s Web site.

Graduate School and Career Opportunities

A major in philosophy offers excellent preparation for many careers
in which clear thinking and analytical ability are valued. Some majors
choose to pursue graduate work in philosophy in preparation for college
or university teaching (Ph.D. normally required), but the philosophy major
also provides the form of rigorous and systematic intellectual training
that is of crucial importance in law, medicine, business, and other fields.

The principal goal of the study of philosophy is to enable students
to think more clearly, deeply, and appreciatively about themselves
and their world. Study of philosophy enhances analytical, critical, and
interpretive capacities that are applicable to any subject matter in almost
any context. It provides many opportunities for expressing oneself, for
reflecting on questions that human beings have pondered for millennia,
for exchanging reasoned beliefs and engaging in focused debate, and for
learning how to come to terms with problems for which there are no easy
answers. A good philosophical education also helps to prepare students
for responsible and intelligent participation in political and community
affairs.

Introduction

The goal of physics is a unified description of the properties of matter
and energy. The study of matter and energy encompasses a range of
phenomena, from the subnuclear to the cosmological. Physics seeks
to understand the way the universe “works,” from the very small scale
(quarks and neutrinos) to the human scale (materials encountered in
daily life) to the structure of the cosmos. Different approaches and
technologies are used in these different regimes.

The areas of active research at UNC–Chapel Hill can be divided into
nuclear physics and nuclear astrophysics, condensed matter and
materials physics, field and particle physics, astronomy and astrophysics,
and biophysics. Often the separation between subfields is not as distinct
as it appears. For example, nuclear and particle physics are used to
address questions in astrophysics. As scientists have learned more
about the universe, they have realized that even the boundaries between
the sciences have blurred. Today, physics shares interests with biology,
chemistry, and computer science. Physicists are also responsible for the
invention of much of our modern technology, including computers, lasers,
medical imaging devices such as MRI and ultrasound, nuclear reactors,
and the World Wide Web.

Physics has played a significant role in shaping modern society and
culture, and some knowledge of physics is essential to fully appreciate
the world. As the frontiers of physics and astronomy have advanced,
old questions have been answered or refined, new questions have been
asked, and major surprises have been encountered. The joy of doing
physics is “To see a world in a grain of sand and a heaven in a wild flower,

hold infinity in the palm of your hand and eternity in an hour” (William
Blake).

Advising

All majors and minors have a primary academic advisor in Steele
Building. Students are encouraged to meet regularly with their advisor
and review their Tar Heel Tracker each semester. The department’s
director of undergraduate studies and faculty advisors work with current
and prospective majors by appointment (see “Contact Information”
above). Faculty advisors are assigned to all physics majors and minors,
and they assist students in a variety of physics related areas, including
physics course planning, undergraduate research opportunities, the
honors program, internships, career opportunities, and graduate school
and fellowship applications. Physics majors are required to meet with
their departmental advisor by appointment prior to registering for any
semester beyond the fourth term in residence. Further information may
be obtained from the department’s Web site under the Undergraduate
Program (http://physics.unc.edu/undergraduate-program).

Graduate School and Career Opportunities

Employers know that physicists understand how to think and reason
effectively about the world, which equips them to solve unconventional
challenging problems. Over 90 percent of physics majors do something
other than teach and conduct research at a university. Physics will
prepare you to pursue anything from medicine to energy to business.
The American Institute of Physics’ Career Resources (http://aip.org/
career-resources) site provides useful information about the careers
of physics bachelor’s degree recipients, including who is hiring them in
North Carolina.

Those who are considering going on to graduate school in physics,
astronomy, and other physical science and engineering fields, should
contact one of the physics advisors. Those who are considering marine
sciences as a graduate specialty should consult the material under
the Department of Marine Sciences. Those who plan careers in health
sciences, including dentistry, medicine, and veterinary medicine, should
consult advisors in the Health Professions Advising Office in Hanes
Hall. Those interested in science teaching can take the educational
coursework required for a high school science teaching license through
the UNC Baccalaureate Education in Science and Teaching (UNC–BEST
(http://unc.edu/uncbest)) program.

The goal of physics is a unified description of the properties of matter
and energy. The study of matter and energy encompasses a range of
phenomena, from the subnuclear to the cosmological. Physics seeks
to understand the way the universe “works,” from the very small scale
(quarks and neutrinos) to the human scale (materials encountered in
daily life) to the structure of the cosmos. Different approaches and
technologies are used in these different regimes.

The goal of physics is a unified description of the properties of matter
and energy. The study of matter and energy encompasses a range of
phenomena, from the subnuclear to the cosmological. Physics seeks
to understand the way the universe “works,” from the very small scale
(quarks and neutrinos) to the human scale (materials encountered in
daily life) to the structure of the cosmos. Different approaches and
technologies are used in these different regimes.

Introduction

Political science is concerned with the description and explanation of
political ideas, institutions, processes, policies, and behavior, both in
the United States and in other countries. The undergraduate program
provides students with a basic knowledge of the political and economic
relationships that exist among nations, international agencies, and
governmental and nongovernmental organizations. It also introduces
students to the role that traditions of thought and political ideologies
have played in shaping our understanding of politics in the past and
today.

Advising

All majors have a primary academic advisor in Steele Building. Students
are strongly encouraged to meet regularly with their advisor and review
their Tar Heel Tracker each semester. Students seeking advice about the
political science major are encouraged to meet with the department’s
undergraduate advisor or the director of undergraduate studies during
their office hours (see contact information above). Further information
on courses, undergraduate research opportunities, the honors program,
careers, and graduate schools may be obtained from the department’s
Web site.

Graduate School and Career Opportunities

Students with a major in political science may choose to continue
their studies in a number of professional areas, including law, business
administration, public administration, public policy analysis, international
relations, and area studies. Students seeking to become professional
political scientists should pursue graduate study in a Ph.D. program in
political science.

The following is a brief listing of careers for which a major in political
science is valuable preparation: positions with government agencies
such as the Foreign Service, with international public organizations
such as agencies in the United Nations, or with internationally oriented
nongovernmental organizations engaged in development projects,
humanitarian relief, or human rights activities; secondary- and university-
level teaching of government and politics; law-related professions;
educational administration at all levels; federal and state government
employment, with its varied administrative, management, and executive
opportunities; governmental research in universities, libraries, and public
affairs agencies; municipal management and general administration; and

Political science is concerned with the description and explanation of
political ideas, institutions, processes, policies, and behavior, both in
the United States and in other countries. The undergraduate program
provides students with a basic knowledge of the political and economic
relationships that exist among nations, international agencies, and
governmental and nongovernmental organizations. It also introduces
students to the role that traditions of thought and political ideologies
have played in shaping our understanding of politics in the past and
today.

The undergraduate major is designed to provide

1. a broad understanding of political ideas, institutions, and issues as a

central element of a general education;

2. a basic knowledge of the governmental process as preparation for

those considering a career in public service as well as for active and
informed citizenship;

3. preprofessional training for students planning to enter law school;

and

4. a foundation in political science for those contemplating

specialization at the graduate level.

Students must earn a grade of C or better in six of the eight political
science courses used to satisfy the core requirements of the major.
This grade requirement does not apply to ECON 101. First-year seminars
do not count toward the political science major. Whenever possible,
students should take an introductory course in a subfield (American

politics, comparative politics, international relations, political theory)
before taking more advanced courses.

Political Science Major, NUS Joint Degree

Political science majors may wish to consider applying for the Joint
Degree Program, an innovative joint undergraduate degree program
joining the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and the National
University of Singapore. UNC–Chapel Hill undergraduates spend
anywhere from two to four semesters at the National University
of Singapore and receive a joint bachelor of arts degree from both
institutions. For further information, contact the Study Abroad Office.

Special Opportunities in Political Science
Honors in Political Science
The honors program provides political science majors the opportunity
to pursue an independent research project over a two-semester period.
Students begin the program by taking POLI 691H in the spring semester
of their junior year. During this course they complete a thesis proposal.

If the proposal is acceptable, students continue their thesis research
in the senior year under the supervision of the honors director and a
faculty advisor in POLI 692H and POLI 693H. A maximum of two honors
thesis courses can count as elective credit in the major. Upon successful
completion of the program, which includes an oral defense of the thesis,
students are awarded a degree with honors or with highest honors in
political science.

To be admitted to the honors program, students must have at least a 3.3
overall grade point average and a 3.5 in political science courses. They
should have completed four courses in the major. Students interested in
participating in the honors program should apply by October 15 of their
junior year.
Experiential Education
Internship courses provide students with the opportunity to earn
academic credit while obtaining practical work experience in agencies
and organizations clearly related to the study of political science.
Political science majors who would like to obtain credit for internship
work in government or public service must enroll in POLI 193. While
this course satisfies the experiential education General Education
requirement, POLI 193 is offered on a Pass/Fail basis only and does
not count towards the eight courses required for the major. For specific
information about the procedures and requirements for POLI 193, please
consult the department’s Web site (http://politicalscience.unc.edu/
undergraduate/internships).
Study Abroad
Because we live in an increasingly globalized society, students are
encouraged to study abroad as they are able. Students interested in the
fields of comparative politics and international relations are strongly
urged to participate in a study abroad program; indeed, all students may
find the experience to be transformational and helpful in choosing a
career path. Students are advised to work with the Study Abroad Office
and to contact the undergraduate advisor when planning their study
abroad experience. For information about applying study abroad credit
toward the political science major, please consult the department’s Web
site (http://politicalscience.unc.edu/undergraduate-programs/current-

Introduction

In the undergraduate study of psychology the emphasis is on a broad
acquaintance with the behavioral sciences, not specialization. The
subject matter is preparatory to a career in psychology either in basic
research and teaching, or in any number of professional applications
to various human problems. A psychology major may prove valuable
to those planning other professional careers such as medicine, law,
education, or business, as well as to those who seek a broad cultural
background in the behavioral sciences.

Advising

All psychology majors have a primary academic advisor in Steele
Building. Students are strongly encouraged to meet regularly with their
advisor and review their Tar Heel Tracker each semester. Several faculty
members (for complete list, click here (http://psychology.unc.edu/
undergraduate-studies/academic-advising)) are available to meet with
current and prospective majors by appointment. Students who are
considering graduate studies in psychology are particularly encouraged
to contact departmental academic advisors. Additional information about
courses, undergraduate research opportunities, the honors program, and
the Psychology Club may be obtained from the department’s Web site.

Graduate School and Career Opportunities

Both the B.A. and B.S. degree programs prepare students for entry into
graduate programs in psychology and a large number of related areas.
Both programs, augmented by courses dictated by various graduate and

professional schools, also provide training that has proved beneficial for
those applying to business, law, and medical schools.

Undergraduate psychology majors seek and find employment in a
wide range of occupations, and many continue their education and
training in graduate school. Students should understand that many of
the occupations traditionally associated with psychology (e.g., clinical
psychologist) are licensed specialties that require graduate training.

Introduction

Public policy is an interdisciplinary social science major designed to
provide students with the theoretical perspective, analytical skill, and
substantive knowledge needed to respond to major domestic and global
policy problems.

The core curriculum includes exposure to multiple disciplinary fields,
including economics, political science, policy analysis, philosophy,
research methods, and statistics.

Advising

All majors and minors have a primary academic advisor in Steele
Building. Students are strongly encouraged to meet regularly with
their advisor and review their Tar Heel Tracker each semester. Public
Policy’s director of undergraduate studies and student services officer
work with current and prospective students by appointment (see
contact information above). For additional information on courses and
undergraduate research opportunities, see the department's Web site
(http://publicpolicy.unc.edu/academics/undergraduate-program).

Graduate School and Career Opportunities

The undergraduate major in public policy provides students with
conceptual and analytical skills that prepare them for work or graduate
school. The integration of a liberal arts education, the development
of writing and analytical abilities, and knowledge in a domestic or
global policy field serves as the spring board for graduate work in many
professions, including business, education, law, non-profit management,
public administration, public health, public policy, public and international
affairs and social work.

Special Opportunities in Public Policy
Honors in Public Policy
Public policy majors who have at least a 3.3 overall grade point and a 3.5
in the core public policy courses are eligible to apply to the department’s
honors program in the spring of their junior year. The honors thesis
offers an opportunity for motivated students to move beyond traditional
coursework and apply critical thinking skills to an academic public policy
thesis. This program is organized as an original, independent research
project under the direction of a faculty adviser.

Completion of an honors thesis provides a total of six credit hours toward
the major, including three credits toward a policy field concentration.
Students who complete an honors thesis and maintain all other
eligibility criteria may be recommended by their thesis advisor and
the Undergraduate Affairs Committee for graduation with honors or
highest honors in public policy. The department's Web site (http://
publicpolicy.unc.edu/academics/undergraduate-program/honors)
provides more information.
Undergraduate Research
Most courses in public policy include a research component. In addition,
the department offers opportunities for students to work directly with

PLCY 581, PLCY 596, PLCY 691H, PLCY 692H, PLCY 696, and PLCY 698
are designated as research-intensive courses, and PLCY 460 and
PLCY 581 are designated as research methods courses by the Office
for Undergraduate Research. Earning a grade of C or better in any of
these courses partially fulfills the requirements for the Carolina Research
Scholar designation. The Duncan MacRae Jr. Public Policy Fund provides
grants on a competitive basis to public policy majors engaged in
mentored research with a public policy faculty member, in policy-relevant
independent research, and in honors thesis research in public policy.
Experiential Education
In keeping with Carolina’s Making Connections Curriculum, the
Department of Public Policy’s experiential education programs offer
students structured, active-learning opportunities that invite them
to integrate and apply their academic knowledge and skills in a real-
world policy environment. Opportunities include internships, the Burch
Field Research Seminar on Domestic and International Affairs in
Washington DC, the public policy clinic (PLCY 393), and the public policy
capstone course (PLCY 698). PLCY 130, PLCY 293, PLCY 393, PLCY 493,
PLCY 691H, PLCY 692H, and PLCY 698 are all approved as experiential
education courses.

For more information, see the department's Web site (http://
publicpolicy.unc.edu/academics/experiential-education).
Capstone Course
The capstone course (PLCY 698) is the culminating experience of the
public policy undergraduate major and is required for all seniors except
those who complete an honors thesis. Students should register for the
course in the fall or spring of their senior year. The course provides a
bridge between policy analysis as it is studied in an academic setting and
policy analysis as it is practiced in the workplace. Students work in small
teams to produce actionable, client-centered, public policy analysis for a
government agency or nonprofit organization.
Internships
Students may receive academic credit for an approved internship if
it provides an academically relevant experience in policy analysis or
research. Students who wish to complete an internship with an external
organization can do so through PLCY 293 (available to public policy
majors and minors). PLCY 293 is a Pass/Fail course. The Duncan
MacRae Jr. Public Policy Internship Grant aims to support internship
opportunities for public policy majors and to defer some of the costs
associated with engaging in unpaid summer internships. The Hodding
Carter III Public Service Fellowship supports opportunities for UNC–
Chapel Hill public policy majors to engage in public service opportunities
in our communities, the American south, the nation, and around the
globe.
Undergraduate Awards
Each year the Department of Public Policy holds a graduation ceremony
to honor students’ achievements. The Richard N.L. (Pete) Andrews
Environmental Policy Fund recognizes a rising senior public policy major
who has been exceptionally engaged in research and/or public service
to find solutions to local, state, national, or global environmental policy
challenges. The Kathy Taft Education Policy Award recognizes a rising
senior majoring in public policy with an interest in and dedication to
education policy. The Michael A. Stegman Award for Policy Research
and Advocacy is awarded to a graduating public policy major who has

demonstrated an ability to use policy research and analysis to advocate
for social change and a commitment to play a future role in policy
research and advocacy.

Graduate School and Career Opportunities

Those wishing to proceed to graduate work in religious studies can
consult the director of undergraduate studies. We encourage students to
pursue the study of two or more languages in which the sacred literatures
of the world have been written, as well as the modern languages
of scholarship. In addition to the language courses offered by this
department, UNC–Chapel Hill offers courses in Greek, Modern Hebrew,
Chinese, Japanese, Hindi-Urdu, Latin, Arabic, Sanskrit, Persian, Bengali,
and Tamil.

Students majoring in religious studies often choose to pursue an M.A.
or Ph.D. in religious studies or other related fields in the humanities
and social sciences. Some of the graduates of the program go on to
professional schools in law, medicine, divinity, or journalism. Each year
the department awards a fellowship, the Bernard Boyd Fellowship, to a
graduating religious studies major who is planning to pursue graduate
study in religion at another institution.

Subjects in this department include: Religious Studies (RELI) (p. 737)
and Jewish Studies (JWST) (p. 751)

The department offers a variety of courses ranging from large lecture
classes to advanced seminars, as well as independent studies, an
honors thesis program, and a capstone course for all majors (RELI 697).
Introductory courses, which are numbered below 200, orient students
to the field of religious studies or to major approaches, topics, or issues
within that broader field. Intermediate courses are numbered between
200 and 399, and they provide more in-depth analysis. Advanced courses,
which are numbered 400 and above, often build on knowledge or skills

derived from lower-level courses, and they provide opportunities for
research-intensive study in particular areas of concentration in the study
of religion.

Contact Information

Department of Romance Studies

Dr. Glynis Cowell, Director of Undergraduate Studies

FEDERICO LUISETTI, Chair

Introduction

The Department of Romance Studies is a diverse, multicultural, and
plurilingual academic unit that engages in research and instruction
in French, Italian, Portuguese, Spanish, and the historical minority
languages of Europe and the Americas. The principal aims of the
department are to preserve, increase, and transmit knowledge and
understanding of the Romance languages, literatures, and cultures within
the global and regional contexts in which they have developed.

Our course offerings present a diversity of approaches—historical,
literary, linguistic, sociopolitical, cultural, and theoretical—to the study of
literary and nonliterary texts and cultures of Europe, the Mediterranean,
and the Americas. Students acquire competence in the practice and
analysis of Romance languages together with a critical knowledge of the
written, oral, and visual traditions of their origin and diaspora. Our faculty
promotes interdisciplinary connections and incorporates the study of
literature, culture, theory, and history across the curriculum. Through
coursework that emphasizes rhetoric, composition, and written and oral
expression, our majors receive sustained personalized training in critical
thinking and close reading.

Advising

All majors and minors can find their primary academic advisor in
Dey Hall. Students are strongly encouraged to meet regularly with
their advisor and review their Tar Heel Tracker each semester. Each
of the department’s language advisors will meet with current and
prospective majors by appointment. Departmental academic advising
is particularly important for those majors who are considering going
on to graduate school. Further information on courses, undergraduate
research opportunities, the honors program, careers, and graduate
schools may be obtained from the department’s Web site (http://
romancestudies.unc.edu).

Facilities

Students taking courses in the Department of Romance Studies have
outstanding support for their work through the Language Resource
Center (LRC), housed on the ground floor of Dey Hall. The LRC provides
resources and services for language teaching and learning, including
audio and video materials; smart classrooms with PCs and projection
equipment; listening, viewing, and recording facilities; and online
databases for language learning.

Graduate School and Career Opportunities

The master of arts in teaching (M.A.T.) degree is intended for students
who wish to teach at the secondary level. M.A. and Ph.D. programs in
Romance languages are almost exclusively oriented toward literary
studies, and the undergraduate student should prepare accordingly. A

University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill            769

reading knowledge of Latin is sometimes required, as is at least one
other Romance language (generally Italian or Spanish). Useful allied
disciplines are English, history, classics, philosophy, linguistics, and art
history. A double major with one of these fields is often desirable. Faculty
members can advise students on choices of graduate schools. Ratings of
programs are published from time to time and are available through the
department.

For students seeking careers in international business and law,
journalism, publishing, social work, and the health professions, a second
major or minor in a language is an asset. This also applies to students
who wish to work in a field that makes knowledge of French, Italian,
Portuguese, or Spanish desirable, such as history, art, Latin American
studies, or global studies.

their major courses. Eligible honors candidates will formulate a topic
and select an appropriate faculty member to supervise the writing of an
honors thesis. Specific coursework for the major with honors consists
of enrollment in a special topics course in the language of the major
emphasis (FREN, ITAL, PORT, or SPAN 691H Research for Advanced
Students) in the fall semester of the senior year, and 692H Honors Thesis
in the spring semester. FREN, ITAL, PORT, SPAN 398 Undergraduate

Seminar may be substituted for the research course if the subject of the
seminar is central to the research project chosen. In the 692H course the
thesis will be completed and the student examined by the supervisor and
two additional faculty members, to be agreed upon by the student and
supervisor. The director of honors, in consultation with the examiners,
will recommend that the student who has defended the thesis graduate
with honors, highest honors, or with course credit. Courses numbered

Special Opportunities in Romance Studies
Honors
The departmental honors program is open to any qualified major with
a cumulative grade point average of 3.3 or higher and 3.5 or higher in
their major courses. Eligible honors candidates will formulate a topic
and select an appropriate faculty member to supervise the writing of an
honors thesis. Specific coursework for the major with honors consists
of enrollment in a special topics course in the language of the major
emphasis (FREN, ITAL, PORT, or SPAN 691H Research for Advanced
Students) in the fall semester of the senior year, and 692H Honors Thesis
in the spring semester. FREN, ITAL, PORT, SPAN 398 Undergraduate
Seminar may be substituted for the research course if the subject of the
seminar is central to the research project chosen. In the 692H course the
thesis will be completed and the student examined by the supervisor and
two additional faculty members, to be agreed upon by the student and
supervisor. The director of honors, in consultation with the examiners,
will recommend that the student who has defended the thesis graduate
with honors, highest honors, or with course credit. Courses numbered
691H or 398 may count toward the eight courses for the major, but 692H
may not. Students who intend to graduate in December should adjust
the scheduling of these courses in order to allow for completion of the
honors project in December. Students meeting the required grade point
averages should contact the undergraduate advisor for their language.
For detailed information on the B.A. with honors, click here (http://
romancestudies.unc.edu/undergraduate/overview).
Out-of-Class Language Experience
Students may enrich their cultural and language experience by applying
to the Spanish House, a section of Craige North residence hall. Equipped
with a lounge and a kitchen, the house has space for eight male and 16
female students. Students make an effort to speak only Spanish while in
residence.

The department offers credit-bearing service-learning opportunities
(http://ccps.unc.edu/apples) through SPAN 293. This course satisfies
the experiential education (EE) General Education requirement and is
always connected to a specific course.

Students also find opportunities to speak Spanish and meet native
Spanish speakers in an informal weekly Tertulia. Additional activities
such as lectures, receptions, and films are organized by the department
and student organizations such as CHispA (Carolina Hispanic
Association). Numerous volunteer opportunities using Spanish are
available in the local community through CHispA, Campus Y, UNC
Hospitals, and other organizations.

For further opportunities to speak French, students are encouraged to
participate in the weekly meeting of the Table Française and become
members of the French club, les Francophiles. Departmental lectures and
film series are also offered.

Students wishing to speak Italian may participate in a weekly
conversation table, La Tavola Italiana. They may also attend
departmental lectures and film series and participate in the Italian
Literary Contest.

Students who wish to practice Portuguese can meet weekly for the “bate-
papo” (chat).

Portuguese is the seventh most spoken language in the world, with over
250 million speakers. It is the language of Portugal, Brazil, and parts of
Africa and Asia. Brazil, with a population of 185 million, is the largest
country in South America and has the ninth largest economy in the world.

The program in Portuguese combines the study of the language,
culture, and literatures of Brazil and Portugal. Emphasis is placed on
the language as it is currently spoken and its historical development.
Students study the literatures of Brazil and Portugal in terms of their
historical development and analyze specific texts from different genres
and literary periods. Students interested in Portuguese should consult the
Portuguese language advisor.

Portuguese as a second language would open multiple job opportunities
in various countries with expanding economies and a promising future. It
would also provide a vehicle to the rich cultural traditions of Portugal and
Brazil, including literature, art, and music.

Spanish, the world’s third largest language and second in terms of native
speakers, is spoken by nearly 500 million people across the globe. The
over 50 million Hispanics in the United States have become the fastest-
growing social and political segment in North America. Because of its
prominence, learning to communicate in Spanish can be essential for
those entering the global economic market and numerous professions.

Spanish studies at UNC–Chapel Hill thrives on innovative literary,
linguistic, and theoretical approaches to the Spanish-speaking world,
and includes the study of indigenous, Afro-descendant, Asian, and other
cultures. Students obtain well-grounded and comprehensive critical
knowledge of the literatures, languages, and cultures of Spain and the

Special Opportunities in Romance Studies
Honors
The departmental honors program is open to any qualified major with
a cumulative grade point average of 3.3 or higher and 3.5 or higher in
their major courses. Eligible honors candidates will formulate a topic
and select an appropriate faculty member to supervise the writing of an
honors thesis. Specific coursework for the major with honors consists
of enrollment in a special topics course in the language of the major
emphasis (FREN, ITAL, PORT, or SPAN 691H Research for Advanced
Students) in the fall semester of the senior year, and 692H Honors Thesis
in the spring semester. FREN, ITAL, PORT, SPAN 398 Undergraduate
Seminar may be substituted for the research course if the subject of the
seminar is central to the research project chosen. In the 692H course the
thesis will be completed and the student examined by the supervisor and
two additional faculty members, to be agreed upon by the student and
supervisor. The director of honors, in consultation with the examiners,
will recommend that the student who has defended the thesis graduate
with honors, highest honors, or with course credit. Courses numbered

691H or 398 may count toward the eight courses for the major, but 692H
may not. Students who intend to graduate in December should adjust
the scheduling of these courses in order to allow for completion of the
honors project in December. Students meeting the required grade point
averages should contact the undergraduate advisor for their language.
For detailed information on the B.A. with honors, click here (http://
romancestudies.unc.edu/undergraduate/overview).
Out-of-Class Language Experience
Students may enrich their cultural and language experience by applying
to the Spanish House, a section of Craige North residence hall. Equipped
with a lounge and a kitchen, the house has space for eight male and 16
female students. Students make an effort to speak only Spanish while in
residence.

The department offers credit-bearing service-learning opportunities
(http://ccps.unc.edu/apples) through SPAN 293. This course satisfies
the experiential education (EE) General Education requirement and is
always connected to a specific course.

Students also find opportunities to speak Spanish and meet native
Spanish speakers in an informal weekly Tertulia. Additional activities
such as lectures, receptions, and films are organized by the department
and student organizations such as CHispA (Carolina Hispanic
Association). Numerous volunteer opportunities using Spanish are
available in the local community through CHispA, Campus Y, UNC
Hospitals, and other organizations.

For further opportunities to speak French, students are encouraged to
participate in the weekly meeting of the Table Française and become
members of the French club, les Francophiles. Departmental lectures and
film series are also offered.

27

Students wishing to speak Italian may participate in a weekly
conversation table, La Tavola Italiana. They may also attend
departmental lectures and film series and participate in the Italian
Literary Contest.

Students who wish to practice Portuguese can meet weekly for the “bate-
papo” (chat).
Study Abroad
The Study Abroad Office sponsors several yearlong, semester-long, and
summer programs appropriate for students of the Romance languages
and has special arrangements with the Department of Romance Studies
for the UNC in Montpellier, UNC in Seville, and Florence programs.
Students from UNC–Chapel Hill and from other institutions may earn up
to 30 semester hours of undergraduate credit in these programs, which
are open to qualified undergraduates regardless of academic major.
Students may satisfy up to 50 percent of their major coursework abroad.

General inquiries concerning any of these programs should be addressed
to the Study Abroad Office, CB# 3130, FedEx Global Education Center,
(919) 962-7002.

Introduction

The Department of Sociology is the primary home for two majors—
sociology and management and society—and a minor in social and
economic justice.

The undergraduate major in sociology at UNC–Chapel Hill provides
students with theoretical, methodological tools, and substantive insights
for understanding human social life and institutions. The department’s
faculty is particularly strong in the areas of social inequality, marriage
and family, the life course and aging, work and the economy, religion,
formal organizations, sex and gender, social movements, population
and human ecology, poverty and welfare, medical sociology, social
networks, education, and political sociology. Course themes range widely
from the theoretical to the applied and incorporate a broad array of
methodological approaches including comparative/historical, participant
observation and interviewing, survey data collection and statistical
analysis.

Management and society is an interdisciplinary major that focuses
on the institutional context and inner workings of organizations. It
prepares students for a variety of positions in private or public-sector
organizations. Additionally, many students find the curriculum to be
excellent preparation for a variety of business-oriented graduate and
professional degree programs.

Advising

All majors and minors have a primary academic advisor in Steele
Building. Students are strongly encouraged to meet regularly with
their advisor and review their Tar Heel Tracker each semester. The
department’s director of undergraduate studies and assistant directors
meet with current, transfer, and prospective majors by appointment (see
contact information on the program page of the catalog). Departmental
academic advising is particularly important for those students who
are double majors and those who may be considering going on to
graduate school. Further information on courses, undergraduate research
opportunities, writing an honors thesis, careers, and graduate schools is
available on the department’s Web site.

Graduate School and Career Opportunities

Sociologists are employed by research institutes, public health and
welfare organizations, social work agencies, private businesses, law
firms, international agencies, medical centers, educational institutions,
advertising firms, survey and polling organizations, and the criminal
justice system. Others work in politics and government and in community
and social justice organizing.

A major in sociology also prepares students for law, medical, or business
school and for graduate degree programs in social work, education,
public policy, religious ministry, mass communications, public health,
nonprofit administration, and international affairs. Of course the

sociology major also prepares interested undergraduates for graduate
studies in sociology, should they choose to continue in the field to
become researchers or teachers in high schools, two- or four-year
colleges, or research universities. Students interested in pursuing
graduate studies in sociology after college may, with the instructor’s
permission, enroll in graduate-level courses at UNC–Chapel Hill.

A major in management and society prepares students for virtually any
aspect of a business career that does not involve highly specialized
training (such as finance and accounting). Employers are interested in
students who can think on their feet, communicate effectively, write well,
and make sense of the social and economic changes occurring in their
industry. Management and society majors are educated in each of these
skills.

Graduates with B.A. degrees with majors in management and society
are especially suited for entry-level positions in any aspect of human
resource management, industry, or public sector organizations. Among
recent graduates who responded to a placement office survey, the
largest number were employed in sales; management or management
training positions with at least some supervisory or personnel-related
responsibilities ranked second. Other graduates are working in customer
service, purchasing, and marketing research, and several hold positions in
the public sector.

Special Opportunities in Sociology and
Management and Society
Honors in Sociology
The department attempts to identify and invite all qualified students
to participate in the senior honors program. Students who are not
contacted, especially double majors, transfer students, and students who
declare their major in sociology relatively late in their college careers,
are encouraged to speak with their major advisor or the department’s
honors advisor no later than the preregistration period during the second
semester of their junior year.

To graduate with honors in sociology, a major must meet the following
requirements:

• At least a 3.3 cumulative grade point average in major courses and all

courses taken at the University

• Completion of an honors thesis based on independent study, which
may involve collection of data by the student, under the supervision
of a faculty thesis advisor

• Participation in an honors seminar program during the fall and spring

semesters of the senior year.

Students may receive credit for one or both senior honors research and
seminar courses (SOCI 691H and SOCI 692H) depending on the extent of
their thesis work.

For more information on honors, contact Professor Howard Aldrich
(howard_aldrich@unc.edu), CB# 3210, 202 Hamilton Hall, (919) 962-5044.
Honors in Management and Society
A student may, as a result of distinguished work (3.3 grade point average
or higher), be awarded a degree with honors or highest honors. This
requires completion of a senior honors thesis. Interested students should
contact the management and society office for more information. Honors
students should enroll in MNGT 691H and MNGT 692H. MNGT 692H will
fulfill one of the course requirements from the social context of business
group listed above.
Student Clubs
The Sociology Club is a student-run, student-driven organization that
may provide relevant presentations, discussions, guidance, and/or
service opportunities in sociology. The Society for Human Resources
Management (SHRM) is a student-run, student-driven organization
that may provide relevant presentations, discussions, guidance, and/or
service and intern opportunities in management and society.
Independent Study and Reading
SOCI 396 may be taken for one to three hours of course credit depending
on the amount of academic work planned by the student. It is usually
taken by juniors and seniors who have completed at least two or three
courses in sociology. Students may use independent study to

• Do reading and research in an area in which no course is offered
• Take advanced or more specialized coursework in a specific area of

sociology

After an area of study has been selected, the student contacts a faculty
member in the department whose interests are in or related to the topic
area. If the faculty member agrees to direct the student’s independent
study, the student needs final approval by the department’s director
of undergraduate studies. It is the student’s and faculty supervisor’s

812         Management and Society Major, B.A.

responsibility to determine the amount of reading and/or outside work
to be done, the frequency with which the student’s progress will be
assessed, and the papers or examinations that will constitute the course
requirements. An approved learning contract is necessary, and some
written work involving sociological analysis is required to receive credit
for SOCI 396. Students must sign up for SOCI 396 before the end of the
first week of classes.
Independent Experiential Internship
Students may combine employment and study in the form of an
internship program for which they receive one to three academic
credits through SOCI 393. The student must assume responsibility for
employment arrangements. Students may not receive credit for paid
employment. The student contacts a faculty member in the department
whose interests are in or related to the area of the internship. If the
faculty member agrees to direct the internship, the student needs final
approval by the department’s director of undergraduate studies. Credit
is not provided for the internship alone; some written work involving
sociological analysis is required to receive credit for SOCI 393. Because
of the expectation that students doing an internship for academic credit
will conduct substantive sociological analysis, it is very important that
planning begin early. Students must secure all approvals for the contract
before the first day of the internship.
Undergraduate Howard W. Odum Award
The Undergraduate Howard W. Odum Award is presented yearly to
a graduating senior who has displayed excellence in undergraduate
sociological achievement. This award was established in 1967 in honor
of Professor Howard Odum, who founded and first chaired the UNC–
Chapel Hill Department of Sociology. Odum was a pioneer in American
sociology and a major influence on the discipline. The department faculty
selects the recipient of the annual award on the basis of grade records
and other demonstrations of academic talent and accomplishment as an
undergraduate.
Undergraduate Research
Students interested in working with faculty on their research projects
should contact the Office for Undergraduate Research for more
information and also speak with the director of undergraduate studies.

Michael Dunn, Assistant Director of Undergraduate Studies
mikewill@live.unc.edu

Management and society is an interdisciplinary major that focuses
on the institutional context and inner workings of organizations. It
prepares students for a variety of positions in private or public-sector
organizations. Additionally, many students find the curriculum to be
excellent preparation for a variety of business-oriented graduate and
professional degree programs.

The phrase “management and society” in its broadest sense
encompasses not only direct dealings between management and
organized labor but also matters such as governmental policy, industrial
psychology, industrial sociology, personnel administration, and worker

education. A broad knowledge and understanding of economics, history,
sociology, psychology, communications, and political science are
essential. Work in this field also requires knowledge of techniques
such as statistics, administrative practices, testing and measurement,
and guidance and counseling. Majors acquire an understanding
of the conceptual foundations and principles of interpersonal and
institutional relations and of the ways these principles can be applied in
the work place. General areas of study are employer-employee relations,
development of human resources, and the institutional context of work.

Some students have combined management and society with
concentrations in such academic disciplines as economics, sociology,
psychology, public policy, history, and political science.

The minor in social and economic justice is designed for students who
want to understand how to think analytically about issues of justice
and how perspectives on justice can be joined with the pursuit of it.
An overarching objective is fostering attitudes and knowledge about
human rights; racial, ethnic, and gender equality; economic justice;
democratic participation; sustainable development; diversity; and
peace. It is especially appropriate for students who anticipate working
in advocacy roles in nonprofit organizations, in local communities, or in
governmental organizations. In these inquiries about justice, students
engage scholarship in a variety of disciplines and traditions of practice.

Service Learning Component
Students are required to complete one service-learning experience, a
requirement that can be met in one of three ways.

1. A student may take a course that includes a service-learning

(APPLES) component.

2. After seeking and receiving the approval of the director of the minor,

a student may take a one- to three-credit independent studies or
special topics course (summer or academic term) with a faculty
member.

3. A student may participate in the two-credit spring break course,

HBEH 610, which meets the service-learning requirement but not a
course requirement.

Note that core courses do not necessarily contain a service-learning
component; check ConnectCarolina each semester to confirm that
courses are listed as APPLES courses.

Thus, the minor is fulfilled with 12 to 13 credits, depending on whether
the service-learning requirement is part of a three-credit course or is
fulfilled in another way.

Introduction

The major in mathematical decision sciences is an excellent program for
students interested in actuarial science, operations research, probability,
or statistics, as well as in fields such as business, economics, planning,
psychology, and biomedicine where the decision and statistical sciences
play an increasingly important role.

Particular areas in which graduates can obtain employment or continue
with graduate study include
Statistics
Probability and statistics are two of the most frequently applied areas
in the mathematical decision sciences. Students in this area study the
mathematical theories of probability and statistics and their application
to mathematical models that contain an element of uncertainty or
randomness. Opportunities for employment are manifold in businesses
and government agencies dealing with many branches of the natural and
social sciences, including pharmacology, environmental sciences, and
many others.
Operations Research
In this area, students study mathematical and statistical techniques
related to decision making. This branch of the mathematical decision
sciences is crucial in business, government, and other management
areas where difficult problems that depend on large amounts of data are
addressed (for example, complex airline route schedules). In addition to
their major courses, students interested in this field are encouraged to
take courses in business and economics.
Actuarial Science
Actuaries are mathematicians who work primarily in businesses
that involve financial risk, including the insurance industry. Students
interested in this field take advanced courses in statistics, stochastic
processes, and the mathematical theory of risk.

Advising

All majors and minors have a primary academic advisor in Steele
Building. Students are strongly encouraged to meet regularly with their
advisor and review their Tar Heel Tracker each semester. After contacting
the mathematical decision sciences office (see “Contact Information”
above), all majors and minors are also assigned an undergraduate
advisor in the department. The department’s undergraduate advisors
discuss course planning with current majors and, if needed, minors

University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill            817

before registration each semester. The director of undergraduate studies
works with prospective majors and minors by appointment. Additional
information on courses, undergraduate research opportunities, the
honors program, careers, and graduate schools may be obtained from the
department’s Web site (http://www.stat-or.unc.edu) or by contacting the
director of undergraduate studies.

Courses for Students from Other
Departments

The Department of Statistics and Operations Research offers a variety
of courses of potential value to students majoring in other disciplines.
Introductory courses include STOR 113 and STOR 215, which are
foundation courses in decision models, and the basic statistical courses,
STOR 151 and STOR 155. At the intermediate level, STOR 305 provides
an introduction to business decision models, while STOR 471 is an
introductory course in actuarial science. Substantial coverage of applied
statistical methods is provided in STOR 455 and STOR 556. At more
advanced mathematical levels, an introduction to probability theory is
provided by STOR 435, and the basic theory of statistical inference is
given by STOR 555. More advanced deterministic and stochastic models
of operations research are provided in STOR 415 and STOR 445.

Graduate School and Career Opportunities

Regardless of the electives chosen, the mathematical decision sciences
degree program provides excellent preparation for graduate study.
Graduates with concentrations in operations research or statistics often
continue work at the graduate level in those fields or related areas such
as industrial engineering, biostatistics, and environmental science, or
enter business school to pursue the master’s in business administration
(M.B.A.) degree.

A five-year B.S.–M.S. degree program in operations research is also
an option. This program is under the direction of the Department of
Statistics and Operations Research. Interested students should consult
the program director.

Graduates in the mathematical decision sciences will find numerous
opportunities for well-paid, challenging jobs.

Introduction

The Department of Women’s and Gender Studies offers a feminist
interdisciplinary course of study that expands the process of knowledge
production to include considerations of gender, race, class, and sexuality
in the United States and internationally. Students will be exposed to
recent scholarship on feminist theory and the intellectual, economic,
political, and artistic contributions of women and feminist movements in
various historical and cultural contexts.

Approximately 30 departments offer over 120 courses that focus on the
study of women and/or gender. Many of these courses have been cross-
listed as women’s and gender studies courses and are identified below;
others are taught as special sections of an established course and are
identified separately each semester.

Advising

All majors and minors have a primary academic advisor in Steele
Building. Students whose first major is women’s and gender studies are
also required to meet with a faculty member in the department before
they can register. All other majors and minors are strongly encouraged
to meet with a faculty member as well. The department’s director
of undergraduate studies also works with current and prospective
majors and minors by appointment (see “Contact Information” above).
Departmental academic advising is particularly important for those
majors who are considering going on to graduate school. All students
are encouraged to review their Tar Heel Tracker each semester. Further
information on courses, undergraduate research opportunities, the
honors program, careers, and graduate schools may be obtained from the
department’s Web site (http://womensstudies.unc.edu).
