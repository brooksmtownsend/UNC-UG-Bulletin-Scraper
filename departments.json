A formal\nprogram in American studies was established in 1968, and exciting\nadditions in American Indian and indigenous studies, Southern studies,\nand global American studies have been added in the past two decades.\nThe Department of American Studies has a tradition of vigorous teaching\nand an innovative curriculum that offers stimulating opportunities to\nstudy the United States and the diversity and influence of its peoples,\ninstitutions, texts, performances, and places. In addition, each of our\nareas of major concentration incorporates global and comparative\nperspectives. The department\u2019s commitment to interdisciplinary\napproaches empowers students to value the nation\u2019s complexity by\nengaging with a variety of historical, literary, artistic, political, social,\ncultural, legal, racial, ethnic, and ethnographic perspectives within and\nbeyond the United States. American studies majors graduate with a\ncomprehension of the dynamics of American culture that prepares them\nto make a responsible and critical difference in the variety of professions\nthey choose to pursue.\n\nThe American studies major offers five areas of concentration, each with\nits own distinct degree requirements.\n\nAdvising\n\nAll majors and minors have a primary academic advisor in Steele\nBuilding. Students are strongly encouraged to meet regularly with\ntheir advisor and review their Tar Heel Tracker each semester. The\ndepartment\u2019s director of undergraduate studies works with current and\nprospective majors and minors by appointment. Further information on\ncourses, opportunities, and honors theses may be obtained from the\ndepartment\u2019s Web site.\n\nGraduate School and Career Opportunities\n\nAmerican studies is an excellent liberal arts major for students interested\nin graduate and professional school study.

Students must propose\ntheir thesis and contract with a faculty advisor during the semester\nprior to the beginning of their senior year. For each semester of honors\nwork, thesis students must submit a signed learning contract to the\nDepartment of American Studies during the registration period. During\nthe two semesters devoted to honors work, students conduct individual\nresearch and prepare an honors thesis under the supervision of a faculty\nmember. Students also will attend a weekly seminar at the discretion\nof the advisor. Students must maintain a 3.3 cumulative grade point\naverage to be eligible. With the approval of the associate or the assistant\ndean for honors, students with a slightly lower average who have a\nreasonable expectation of meeting the requirement within one more\nsemester may embark upon the honors thesis, understanding that if they\ndo not attain the 3.3 standard they may continue the research project as\nindependent study but are not eligible to graduate with honors or highest\nhonors.\nExperiential Education\nThe Department of American Studies offers a seminar on Service\nLearning in America (AMST\u00a0398) and offers credits for approved\ninternship projects (AMST\u00a0493). Students have learned about American\nstudies by serving the community in museums, schools, social agencies,\nand other cultural institutions.\nStudy Abroad\nThe Department of American Studies encourages students to consider\na semester or more of study abroad and has developed close relations\nwith several American studies programs in different countries. Studying\nAmerican experience in international contexts is an integral part of\nunderstanding the place and influence of the United States in the\nworld. Student learning is enhanced by the perspectives gained by\nexamining how American subjects are taught in universities around\nthe globe as well as by encountering the international students who\nenroll in American studies courses in Chapel Hill. Study abroad offers\nstudents of folklore the opportunity to understand the rich vernacular\nand traditional cultures of other parts of the world from both a local\nand a comparative perspective. Students can receive American studies\nmajor credit for selected study abroad programs and are encouraged\nto make study abroad part of their academic plans. Study abroad\ncourses can count toward the international American studies major or\nminor. Students interested in this experience should consult with the\ndirector of undergraduate studies or with the Study Abroad Office about\ninternational exchange programs sponsored by UNC\u2013Chapel Hill.\nUndergraduate Awards\nThe department awards Julia Preston Brumley Travel Scholarships to\nhelp fund international travel and study abroad. The Peter C. Baxter\nMemorial Prize is awarded annually to the outstanding senior majoring in\nAmerican studies.\nUndergraduate Research\nThe Department offers credit for AMST\u00a0396 and FOLK\u00a0495.

These realms are often deeply grounded in tradition; this\ndoesn\u2019t mean, however, that they\u2019re always or necessarily old. Just as\ncommunities change their own sense of self in response to shifting\nsocial, political, and economic realities, so too does the artistry they\ncreate evolve. Folklore thus moves beyond the study of the old and time-\nhonored to explore emergent meanings and cultural forms. Trending\ntweets, food trucks, slam poetry, and hip hop freestyling are just as\nrelevant to folklorists\u2019 study as are string-band tunes, Cherokee quilts,\nfamily recipes, and blues. The communities that our students study\nare equally broad, ranging from Lumbee sheetrock workers and Latino\nline cooks to urban homesteaders and Black Lives Matter activists. The\nmain way that we explore contemporary folklore, in turn, is ethnographic\nfieldwork, the real-world study of people\u2019s lives in everyday settings,\ngrounded in conversation and participatory engagement. Students may\npetition the director of undergraduate studies to have courses not listed\napproved to fulfill major requirements; such courses will be evaluated on\na case-by-case basis.\n\nDepartment Programs\nMajors\n\n\u2022 American Studies Major, B.A. (p.\u00a0128)\n\u2022 American Studies Major, B.A.\u2013American Indian and Indigenous\n\nStudies Concentration (p.\u00a0133)\n\n\u2022 American Studies Major, B.A.\u2013Folklore Concentration (p.\u00a0135)\n\u2022 American Studies Major, B.A.\u2013Global American Studies\n\nConcentration (p.\u00a0137)\n\n\u2022 American Studies Major, B.A.\u2013Southern Studies Concentration\n\n(p.\u00a0139)\n\nMinors\n\n\u2022 American Studies Minor (p.\u00a0141)\n\u2022 American Indian and Indigenous Studies Minor (p.\u00a0142)\n\u2022 Folklore Minor (p.\u00a0144)\n\u2022 Global American Studies Minor (p.\u00a0145)\n\u2022 Southern Studies Minor (p.\u00a0146)\n\nGraduate Programs\n\n\u2022 Ph.D. in American Studies (http://catalog.unc.edu/graduate/schools-\n\ndepartments/american-studies)\n\n\u2022 M.A. in Folklore (http://catalog.unc.edu/graduate/schools-\n\ndepartments/american-studies)\n\n\f136\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  American Studies Major, B.A.\u2013Folklore Concentration\n\n\u2022 Graduate Minor in American Studies (http://catalog.unc.edu/\n\ngraduate/schools-departments/american-studies)\n\n\u2022 Graduate Minor in Folklore (http://catalog.unc.edu/graduate/schools-\n\ndepartments/american-studies)\n\nRequirements\n\nIn addition to the program requirements listed below, students must\n\n\u2022 attain a final cumulative GPA of at least 2.0\n\u2022 complete a minimum of 45 academic credit hours earned from UNC-\n\nChapel Hill courses\n\n\u2022 take at least half of their major course requirements (courses and\n\ncredit hours) at UNC-Chapel Hill\n\n\u2022 earn a minimum of 18 hours of C or better in the major core\n\nrequirements (some majors require 21 hours).\n\nFor more information, please consult the degree requirements section of\nthe catalog (p.\u00a092).\n\nThe concentration in folklore consists of nine courses.

Students also will attend a weekly seminar at the discretion\nof the advisor. Students must maintain a 3.3 cumulative grade point\naverage to be eligible. With the approval of the associate or the assistant\ndean for honors, students with a slightly lower average who have a\nreasonable expectation of meeting the requirement within one more\nsemester may embark upon the honors thesis, understanding that if they\ndo not attain the 3.3 standard they may continue the research project as\nindependent study but are not eligible to graduate with honors or highest\nhonors.\nExperiential Education\nThe Department of American Studies offers a seminar on Service\nLearning in America (AMST\u00a0398) and offers credits for approved\ninternship projects (AMST\u00a0493). Students have learned about American\nstudies by serving the community in museums, schools, social agencies,\nand other cultural institutions.\nStudy Abroad\nThe Department of American Studies encourages students to consider\na semester or more of study abroad and has developed close relations\nwith several American studies programs in different countries. Studying\nAmerican experience in international contexts is an integral part of\nunderstanding the place and influence of the United States in the\nworld. Student learning is enhanced by the perspectives gained by\nexamining how American subjects are taught in universities around\nthe globe as well as by encountering the international students who\nenroll in American studies courses in Chapel Hill. Study abroad offers\nstudents of folklore the opportunity to understand the rich vernacular\nand traditional cultures of other parts of the world from both a local\nand a comparative perspective. Students can receive American studies\nmajor credit for selected study abroad programs and are encouraged\nto make study abroad part of their academic plans. Study abroad\ncourses can count toward the international American studies major or\nminor.

Anthropological expertise has special application for hidden\nhistories and the ancient past; the intersection of human biology and\necology; and the way communities create and use meaning, values, and\nhistory in everyday life. We support studies, research, and professional\napplications in these areas with three programs of foundational training:\narchaeology; human biology, ecology, and evolution; and sociocultural\nanthropology.\n\nCutting across these specializations, the department supports\nconcentrations that integrate anthropology\u2019s diverse expertise to address\ncontemporary world problems. Programming in these areas helps\nstudents connect their anthropological studies to work and life beyond\nthe University. Current concentrations focus on health, medicine, and\nhumanity; heritage and unwritten histories; global engagement; race,\nplace and power; and food, environment, and sustainability.\n\nTogether, the Department of Anthropology\u2019s programs and\nconcentrations offer the undergraduate student one of the best\nintroductions possible to our biological and cultural pasts and to our\ncontemporary world. Anthropology majors thus develop the written\nand oral skills needed to live and work in a complex world marked\nby an accelerated rate of environmental, social, and cultural change.\nAnthropology majors acquire general knowledge and skills valued within\na large number of occupations and professions, including but not limited\nto professional anthropology.\n\nAdvising\n\nAll majors and minors have a primary academic advisor in Steele\nBuilding. Students are strongly encouraged to meet regularly with\ntheir advisor and review their Tar Heel Tracker each semester.\nThe department\u2019s director of undergraduate studies (see \u201cContact\nInformation\u201d above) works with current and prospective majors and\nminors by appointment. Students are encouraged to consult with the\ndirector of undergraduate studies about course choices and field work\nopportunities. Departmental academic advising is particularly important\nfor those majors who are considering going on to graduate school.\nFurther information on courses, undergraduate research opportunities,\nand the honors program may be obtained from the department\u2019s Web\nsite.\n\nGraduate School and Career Opportunities\n\nThere are three basic career paths for B.A.-level anthropology majors:\n\n\u2022 Anthropology majors have open to them all of the career options\n\nof any student with a bachelor of arts degree in the liberal arts and\nsocial sciences, with the added advantage that they surely are more\n\nprepared than most in the growing international arena of business,\ngovernment, and nongovernmental organizations (NGOs). The\nresources and professional staff of University Career Services and\nthe department\u2019s director of undergraduate studies can provide\nguidance.\n\n\u2022 Anthropology majors can seek a career that puts their anthropology\n\ndegree directly into practice.\n\n\u2022 Lastly, anthropology majors can continue with graduate education in\norder to seek a career in education, either as a social studies teacher\nin a school or a professor in a university.

An honors course fulfills the same\n\nrequirements as the nonhonors version of that course. Enrollment\nand GPA restrictions may apply.\n\n1\n\nThe theoretical perspectives requirement serves as the major\u2019s core\ncourse; it offers an integrative perspective on the theories and history\nof anthropology and explores what it means to be an anthropologist.\nMajors should fulfill this requirement in their junior year. If they\ncannot do so, they should consult with the director of undergraduate\nstudies.\n\nThe department recommends that majors enroll in some field-oriented\ncoursework such as ANTH\u00a0393, ANTH\u00a0395, ANTH\u00a0451, ANTH\u00a0453, or in\nstudy abroad coursework.\n\nSpecial Opportunities in Anthropology\nHonors in Anthropology\nWriting an honors thesis is an excellent way to cap one\u2019s major in\nanthropology. The process offers students the chance to carry out\noriginal research on a topic that they are passionate about. Our thesis\nwriters work closely with a faculty advisor and committee members to\ndevelop their project. The department provides excellent support, offering\na specific seminar during the fall (ANTH\u00a0691H) and a corresponding\nindependent study (ANTH\u00a0692H), that together walk students through\nthe essential steps of research design and writing. For our students,\nwriting an honors thesis continues to prove a pivotal experience\u2014at once\na capstone to their studies at Carolina and an achievement to carry with\nthem into their lives and careers beyond.\n\nTo pursue an honors thesis project, students must:\n\n\u2022 Maintain a minimum grade point average of 3.3 from the spring\n\nsemester of\u00a0the junior\u00a0year through the entirety of the senior year\n\n\u2022 Secure a faculty advisor who is an anthropologist at UNC-Chapel Hill.\n\u2022 Successfully complete the ANTH\u00a0691H and ANTH\u00a0692H sequence\n\u2022 Receive approval from UNC\u2019s Office for Human Research Ethics prior\n\nto the start of research, for all projects involving human subjects\n\nThe process for approval requires several steps:\n\n\u2022 Students considering an honor thesis should first contact the director\n\nof undergraduate studies or the honors thesis seminar instructor,\nduring their junior year (or earlier).\n\n\u2022 Eligible students next should secure an advisor prior to enrolling in\nANTH\u00a0691H for the fall semester of their senior year. Typically, the\nadvisor is a professor that they have worked with in a class or faculty\nmember with shared interests.\n\n\u2022 In the fall students develop their research design and begin to write\n\ntheir thesis (ANTH\u00a0691H).\n\n\u2022 In the spring, students complete an independent study with their\n\nadvisor, focusing on writing the thesis (ANTH\u00a0692H). Students also\nform their committee, by adding two additional faculty members.\n\n\u2022 To complete the process, students defend (i.e., present and discuss)\n\ntheir thesis to their committee.\u00a0\n\nInternships, Field Work, and Independent Study\nStudents who wish to explore an anthropological concern outside the\nconventional classroom setting, or who desire advanced or specialized\n\nANTH\u00a0393 provides anthropology students the opportunity to engage in\ninternships or other field experiences within or beyond the University that\nhave a significant anthropological learning component. Variable credit\nmay be obtained for this course. ANTH\u00a0393 is a controlled enrollment\ncourse; it requires the permission in advance of the faculty member\nsponsoring the internship, of a responsible official of the agency in which\nthe internship is carried, and of the director of undergraduate studies. It is\nessential that students make arrangements and secure permissions prior\nto the semester of the internship.\n\nANTH\u00a0396 provides anthropology students the opportunity to engage\nin independent study, and ANTH\u00a0395, the opportunity to engage in field\nresearch, in both cases under the mentoring of a specific faculty member.\nVariable credit may be obtained for these courses, although three units\nare usually expected. ANTH\u00a0396 and ANTH\u00a0395 require the permission of\nthe faculty member under whom the student wishes to conduct research\nprior to the semester in which ANTH\u00a0396 or ANTH\u00a0395 is taken. Both are\ncontrolled enrollment courses. In general, these courses should be taken\nonly by students with some prior coursework in anthropology or a related\nsocial science.\n\nANTH\u00a0451 and ANTH\u00a0453 are six-unit field school courses in which the\nstudent gains hands-on experience in research and study in the field\nunder the direction of a faculty member.\n\nAnthropology majors are limited to having no more than six credit\nhours of field-oriented coursework (ANTH\u00a0393, ANTH\u00a0395, ANTH\u00a0451, or\nANTH\u00a0453) count toward meeting the major requirement, although they\nare not restricted from enrolling in more than six credit hours of these\ncourses combined.\nStudy Abroad\nAnthropology majors are encouraged to enroll in a study abroad\nprogram. These programs can offer direct experience of another culture\nand intensive language training, as well as excellent coursework in\nanthropology. By consulting with their departmental advisors as well\nas with the University\u2019s Study Abroad Office, students can assess the\nrelevance of available programs to their interests and arrange to transfer\ncredit hours to count toward their undergraduate degree and, where\nappropriate, the anthropology major. Study abroad programs are often\naffordable even to students who require financial aid. Information about\nstudent loans and scholarships for the purpose of studying abroad can\nbe obtained from the Study Abroad Office.\nUndergraduate Awards\nThe Honigmann Undergraduate Honors Thesis Award is given each year\nto the student who completed the best undergraduate honors project.\n\nGeneral Anthropology Minor\nContact Information\n\nDepartment of Anthropology\nhttp://anthropology.unc.edu\n301 Alumni Building, CB#3115\n(919) 962-1243\n\nAnna Agbe-Davies, Director of Undergraduate Studies\nagbe-davies@unc.edu\n\n\fAnthropology is the integrative study of human beings at all times and in\nall places.

During the senior year the student enrolls in a two-semester course\nsequence, ARCH\u00a0691H and ARCH\u00a0692H, which provides the opportunity\nto carry out an independent research project and write a thesis under\nthe direction of the faculty advisor. Prior to registering for the honors\ncourses, the student and faculty mentor must fill out a contract and\nhave it signed by the curriculum\u2019s director of undergraduate studies.\nThe thesis is evaluated by a committee consisting of the advisor and\ntwo readers. The advisor and at least one reader must be members of\nthe Curriculum in Archaeology\u2019s faculty. A student who successfully\ncompletes the thesis may be awarded honors or highest honors by the\ncommittee. Highest honors is awarded only in cases where the thesis is\njudged to be exceptional in comparison to other such works.\nResearch Laboratories of Archaeology\nFounded in 1939, the Research Laboratories of Archaeology (RLA) was\nthe first center for the study of North Carolina archaeology. Serving the\ninterests of students, scholars, and the general public, it is currently\none of the leading institutes for archaeological teaching and research in\nthe South. Located within the College of Arts and Sciences, it provides\nsupport and research opportunities for UNC\u2013Chapel Hill students\n\nUniversity of North Carolina at Chapel Hill \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  173\n\nworking not only in North Carolina but also throughout the Americas and\noverseas.\nDuke\u2013UNC Consortium for Classical and Mediterranean\nArchaeology (CCMA)\nThe Duke\u2013UNC Consortium for Classical and Mediterranean Archaeology\nrepresents a collaboration between the institutions in order to enhance\narchaeology curricula and concentrations in the respective departments\nand programs in archaeology. The consortium fosters an interdisciplinary\ndialogue on methods, theory, and practice in classical archaeology and\nmaterial culture, providing students access to coursework, seminars,\nexcavations, and other research opportunities; academic advising; and\navenues for curricular and extracurricular interaction.\nExperiential Education\nThe development of skills and perspectives beyond the classroom is\nconsidered central to the curriculum in archaeology. Hands-on training\nin field archeology provides students with the basic tools not only\nnecessary for graduate training and advanced research in archaeology,\nbut also for careers in cultural resource and heritage management\nthrough government agencies, contract firms, and museums. Developing\nan understanding of context and physical environment in archaeology\nrequires field and laboratory experiences that are impossible to teach\neffectively in the classroom. Excavation and laboratory experiences allow\nstudents to participate directly in faculty research and to learn firsthand\nimportant aspects of the research process. Two or more field schools in\narchaeology are generally offered during summer sessions through the\nStudy Abroad Office by faculty from the departments of anthropology,\nclassics, religious studies, and history. In addition, many faculty research\nassociates offer laboratory experiences through independent study\nprojects and internships. These field work and laboratory experiences are\ndesigned to enhance the classroom training, allowing students to work\nas assistants to field archaeologists and specialists\u2014such as surveyors,\narchaeological architects, palaeoethnobotanists, zooarchaeologists,\nbiological anthropologists, and geomorphologists\u2014learning firsthand\nvarious aspects of data recovery, processing, and interpretation\nassociated with archaeological field projects.\n\nArchaeology Minor\nContact Information\nDepartment of Archaeology\nhttp://archaeology.unc.edu\n108 Alumni Building, CB# 3120\n(919) 962-6574\n\nProfessor Scarry, Chair\nscarry@email.unc.edu\n\nAnna Agbe-Davies, Director of Undergraduate Studies\nagbe-davies@unc.edu\n\nThe minor in archaeology draws on a number of disciplines and\ndepartments\u2014principally anthropology, classics, and art\u2014in the study\nof the ancient world, the reconstruction of past lifeways, and the\ninterpretation of ancient social, political, and economic systems.\n\nThe minor helps prepare students for graduate study in anthropological\narchaeology, classical archaeology, cultural resource management,\nand historical preservation.

From a strong\ncentral core in the traditional practices of making and interpreting art,\nthe faculty and students at UNC\u2013Chapel Hill move out in innovative and\npersonal directions. We cultivate exchange between studio art and art\nhistory and offer maximum flexibility within our individual programs.\n\nThe art history curriculum is designed to help students acquire an\nindividual perspective on their own values and beliefs and on their places\nin a society increasingly shaped by visual communication. Majors and\nminors in art history become acquainted with the historical significance,\ncultural diversity, and intellectual richness of human artistic traditions,\nenabling students to investigate the complex roles played by the arts in a\nvariety of social contexts.\n\nThe studio art program encourages experimentation, crossing\nboundaries, and hybrid processes as well as engaging the history and\ntraditions of art. Through directed practice and creative research, faculty\nwork closely with students to stimulate aesthetic and intellectual inquiry,\nimpart portable skills, and motivate self-exploration to help students\ncreate outstanding works of art.\n\nStudents may choose from a range of studio coursework designed to\ndevelop both skills and a personal creative vision. Students develop two\ncritical skills: the means of self-expression and techniques for creative\nthinking. While the undergraduate program focuses on the fine arts, the\ncourse of study nonetheless offers a sound foundation for students to\nmove into art education, design fields, and other art-related careers as\nwell as preparation for further study or careers in the fine arts.\n\nCredit by Examination\n\nStudents who pass the Advanced Placement (AP) examination in art\nhistory and earn a score of 4 or 5 will receive credit for ARTH\u00a0152.\n\nStudents who fulfill the studio art portfolio requirements for the\nAdvanced Placement (AP) examination and earn a score of 4 or 5 will\nreceive placement only (PL) for ARTS\u00a0102, ARTS\u00a0103, or ARTS\u00a0104.\n\nStudents who score a 3 can petition to waive relevant prerequisites via\nportfolio review, although no course credit will be given. Students earning\na score of 6 or higher on the International Baccalaureate (IB) portfolio\nwill receive placement only (PL) for ARTS\u00a0104. Students who score a 5 on\nthe IB may petition for a portfolio review to determine if they can exempt\nARTS\u00a0102 or ARTS\u00a0104.\nAdvanced Placement by Portfolio Review\nIn addition to the threshold scores mentioned above, art majors who\nhave broad experience in visual art may petition to exempt foundation\nrequirements by submitting a portfolio for review. If the review is\nsuccessful, students do not receive credit for these courses; rather, the\ncredit hours are redistributed to the studio concentration or elective\nrequirement of the major. Portfolio requirements are modeled after the\nCollege Board Advanced Placement portfolio guidelines. These guidelines\nare available from the director of undergraduate studies in studio art,\nthe student services administrator, or on the art majors\u2019 Sakai site.\nPortfolios are reviewed annually in September. Contact the director of\nundergraduate studies in studio art at the beginning of the fall semester\nto make arrangements.\n\nAdvising\n\nAll majors and minors have a primary academic advisor in Steele\nBuilding. Students are strongly encouraged to meet regularly with\ntheir advisor and review their Tar Heel Tracker each semester. The\ndepartment\u2019s directors of undergraduate studies and undergraduate\nadvisors work with current and prospective majors by appointment (see\n\u201cContact Information\u201d above). On request, art history majors may be\nassigned an individual faculty advisor. The studio area also holds general\nadvising sessions prior to registration each semester. Departmental\nacademic advising is particularly important for those majors who are\nconsidering honors thesis work or graduate school. Further information\non courses, undergraduate research opportunities, and the honors\nprogram may be obtained from the department\u2019s Web site.\n\nAdditionally, special informational sessions are held periodically to\nguide students on awards, study abroad, internships, and research\nopportunities (especially the Summer Undergraduate Research\nFellowships). These sessions are announced on the art majors' listserv\nand Sakai site, as well as by posters in the Hanes Art Center and Art Lab.\n\nFacilities\n\nThe department possesses outstanding facilities for the teaching of both\nart history and studio art in the Hanes Art Center. The building houses\nstate-of-the-art facilities for image projection required in art history.\nSpecialized classrooms for art practice include large studios for painting,\ndrawing, and mixed media. A dedicated space is available for installation\nprojects. The John C. Henry Printmaking Studio is a wonderfully spacious\n3,325 square foot laboratory providing ambient work space for a variety\nof printmaking processes. Studios for photography include both wet\n(black and white) and digital photography and a dedicated shooting\nstudio. The digital laboratories at UNC\u2013Chapel Hill are Mac-based, with\nthe most current software needed for work in photography (including\nlarge-scale output), video, and digital/electronic media. Students enrolled\nin studio art classes have 24-hour access to these laboratories. In\naddition, the 17,686 square-foot Art Lab, located 1.8 miles north of the\nHanes Art Center (108 Airport Drive), houses the department\u2019s sculpture\nfacilities.\n\nDepartment of Art resources also include the Joseph C.

The\nUniversity\u2019s Ackland Art Museum is located adjacent to the Hanes Art\nCenter. The Ackland\u2019s programming regularly augments the educational\nexperience of the University community.\n\nThe John and June Allcott Galleries in the Hanes Art Center are sites\nfor numerous exhibitions throughout the year. The main gallery has an\nexhibition schedule of 12 to 15 shows each year, including the annual\naward and graduation shows of undergraduate work as well as work by\nprofessional artists, faculty members, and graduate students. The John\nand June Allcott Undergraduate Gallery is the exhibition space designed\nespecially for work produced or chosen by undergraduate students. The\nAlumni Sculpture Garden occupies the grounds surrounding the Hanes\nArt Center. Temporary exhibitions of sculpture are commissioned by the\ndepartment and are on display for a two-year period.

The department oversees\na joint graduate and undergraduate program at these institutions. While\na complete curriculum is offered on the UNC\u2013Chapel Hill campus,\nstudents can elect to take any number of classes at NC State. The joint\nprogram also leverages the industry resources in Research Triangle Park,\nlocated roughly half way between the two campuses, providing unique\nopportunities for students.\n\nBiomedical engineering is a profession that develops and applies\nengineering knowledge and experience to solve problems in biology\nand medicine and to enhance health care. Biomedical engineers are\nprofessionally trained to combine the rigors of medical and biological\nstudies with the power of engineering analysis and design. People\nbecome biomedical engineers to be of service to others, to enjoy the\nexcitement of understanding living systems, and to use state-of-the-\nart science and technology to solve the complex problems of medical\ncare. The emphasis in biomedical engineering is on finding solutions by\nresearching, testing, and applying medical, biological, chemical, electrical,\nand materials engineering approaches. Biomedical engineers are unique\nindividuals who make contributions to health care that are both satisfying\nto themselves and beneficial to others.\n\nFacilities\n\nThe Department of Biomedical Engineering houses an undergraduate\nstudent design laboratory. It contains equipment for rapid prototyping\n(three-dimensional printer and laser cutter), as well as electronics and\nmicrocontroller design and development. Students also use facilities\nin other departments that have laboratory-based courses. The BeAM\nMakerspace facilities are available to all UNC students, and these\nfacilities house a variety of mechanical and electronic fabrication tools.\nMore information is available at the UNC BeAM Web site.\n\nGraduate School and Career Opportunities\n\nMany students from this program have pursued further education in\ngraduate school in biomedical engineering. Our alumni have attended\nmany of the top-ranked biomedical engineering programs. In addition,\nsome students have pursued graduate degrees in other disciplines\nin engineering, as well as related fields such as microbiology, sports\nphysiology, public health, and business/engineering management, among\nothers. Students have also been accepted into clinical programs such\nas medical, dental, physical therapy, and pharmacy schools (in many\n\nUniversity of North Carolina at Chapel Hill \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  277\n\ncases, the student must take several additional courses to meet the\nrequirements for clinical programs).\n\nFor those interested in going directly into a career, biomedical\nengineering is one of the fastest growing career opportunities.

KOSOROK, Chair\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe Department of Biostatistics in the Gillings School of Global Public\nHealth was the first undergraduate program in the country to offer\nan undergraduate degree in biostatistics. The degree provides an\nexcellent foundation for continued studies (primarily graduate school in\nbiostatistics, epidemiology, or medical school) and a strong foundation\nfor employment in the health care industry for highly qualified students\ninterested in quantitative methods applied to public health and medicine.\n\nAdvising\n\nThe program director serves as the academic advisor for all biostatistics\nundergraduates. Undergraduate students are encouraged to meet\nregularly with the program director and review their Tar Heel Tracker\neach semester. In addition, they can also visit the Office of Student\nServices. Departmental academic advising is particularly important for\nthose students who are considering proceeding to graduate school,\ndouble majoring, or pursuing the dual B.S.P.H.\u2013M.S. degree. Further\ninformation may be obtained in the Academic Information Manual (http://\nsph.unc.edu/bios/bios-degrees).\n\nFacilities\n\nThe Department of Biostatistics has a student library, a student study\nroom, and computer facilities for its students.\n\nGraduate School and Career Opportunities\n\nIn recent years, the majority of undergraduate biostatistics students from\nthis program have chosen to attend medical school or graduate school\nin biostatistics (or other closely related fields) following graduation.\nMore than 65 percent of recent graduates have entered medical school\nor graduate programs (primarily biostatistics) immediately following\ngraduation. Recent graduates are attending top-ranked medical schools\nat Johns Hopkins University, Vanderbilt University, University of\nVirginia, Duke University, and UNC\u2013Chapel Hill. Biostatistics graduate\nprograms where students have matriculated immediately following\ncompletion of this undergraduate program include the University of\nWashington\u2013Seattle, Harvard, UNC\u2013Chapel Hill, and the University of\nMichigan. Previous graduates who chose to seek employment have\ntaken positions in the pharmaceutical industry, contract research\norganizations, and medical settings. Examples of employers of recent\ngraduates include Duke Clinical Research Institute, Blue Cross Blue\nShield, Rho, PPD, National Institutes of Environmental Health Science,\nand Research Triangle Institute. Traditionally, career opportunities have\nbeen outstanding for skilled biostatisticians.\n\nMajor\n\n\u2022 Biostatistics Major, B.S.P.H. (p.\u00a0286)\n\nAdministration\n\nMICHAEL R.

One certainly is that it affords an opportunity\nto make pioneering discoveries at the forefront of science, using\ninstrumentation and techniques far more sophisticated than those\nusually encountered in standard laboratory courses.\n\nMore than 80 students are involved in undergraduate research\nprojects in chemistry each year. Although successful completion of\nan undergraduate research project is a requirement for graduation\nwith honors or highest honors (see above), it is not necessary to be a\nparticipant in Honors Carolina to undertake a research project.\n\nThe usual mechanism for becoming involved in a research project is\nto register for CHEM\u00a0395. This process begins well in advance of a\npreregistration or registration period with a visit to the Chemistry Student\nServices office, where a student may obtain a list of undergraduate\nresearch opportunities and a form titled Request for Registration in\nCHEM\u00a0395.\n\nMost students begin research during the spring semester of their junior\nyear and continue throughout their senior year. CHEM\u00a0395 and CHEM\u00a0396\n\n\ftogether may be taken for credit as many times as desired but may be\ncounted for no more than nine hours total credit toward graduation in\neither the B.A. or B.S. traditional and polymer tracks and for no more than\nsix hours in the B.S. biochemistry track.

To attain this\ndistinction the candidate must have nominally satisfied the following\nguidelines:\n\n\u2022 Have achieved a chemistry major grade point average of 3.40 or\n\nhigher\n\n\u2022 Have received no grade below B- in junior- or senior-level chemistry\n\ncourses\n\n\u2022 Have completed at least three lecture courses in chemistry numbered\n\nCHEM\u00a0420 or above\n\n\u2022 Have completed or be about to complete a research project certified\n\nto be of honors quality by the research advisor and two faculty\nmembers appointed by the vice chair for undergraduate studies\n\nStudents who wish to qualify for either of these awards should begin\nplanning their course programs and research activities in the junior year\nso that ample time and effort may be devoted to succeeding in upper-\nlevel courses and research.\nDepartmental Involvement\nMajors are encouraged to participate in AXE (chemistry fraternity) and\nthe undergraduate advisory board.\nLaboratory Teaching Internships and Assistantships\nUndergraduates have the opportunity to serve as laboratory teaching\nassistants for entry-level undergraduate laboratory courses.\nSpecial Topics\nSpecial topics not offered through the normal course sequence may be\npursued through directed reading and registration in CHEM\u00a0396 with the\napproval of the supervising faculty member, advisor, and vice chair for\nundergraduate studies. An approved learning contract is required, and\nstudents must be registered no later than the end of the first week of\nclasses.\nUndergraduate Awards\nExcellent performances by undergraduates in chemistry are recognized\nby the department through the following awards:\n\n\u2022 Francis P. Venable Medal: A medallion and cash award are presented\n\nto the two most outstanding graduating seniors majoring in\nchemistry in honor of Dr. Francis P. Venable, who was chair of the\ndepartment, president of the University from 1900 to 1914, and\npresident of the American Chemical Society.\n\n\u2022 Emmett Gladstone Rand Premedical Scholarship: A scholarship is\n\npresented to an exceptionally talented graduating senior intending to\npursue a career in medicine.\n\n\u2022 Jason D. Altom Memorial Award for Undergraduate Research: This\n\ncash award recognizes research potential of an undergraduate\nchemistry major.\n\n\u2022 J. Thurman Freeze Scholarship: This scholarship serves to fund\nsummer research between a student\u2019s junior and senior years.\n\u2022 E.C. Markham Summer Research Fund: The department chair\n\nselects the recipient of this award, who will use the salary to perform\nresearch between the junior and senior years.\n\n\u2022 Carrie Largent Award for Research Excellence: This award is given\n\nannually to a graduating senior who has excelled in research.\n\n\u2022 David L. Stern Scholar: Top students from upper-division laboratory\n\ncourses are chosen for this cash award.\n\n\u2022 AXE Sophomore Chemist Award: A cash award and certificate are\n\npresented to an outstanding sophomore chemistry major.\n\u2022 James H. Maguire Memorial Award: This award goes to an\n\noutstanding and academically gifted junior honors student majoring\nin chemistry.\n\n\u2022 Tanya R. Ellison Scholarship: A female, junior or senior B.S. chemistry\n\nmajor is selected for this cash award on the basis of character and\nacademic commitment.\n\n\u2022 Hypercube Scholar Award: An outstanding senior majoring in\n\nchemistry is given this chemical software package.\n\nUndergraduate Research\nAlmost every undergraduate chemistry major who has undertaken a\nresearch project has found it to be an exciting and rewarding experience.\nThe reasons are many. One certainly is that it affords an opportunity\nto make pioneering discoveries at the forefront of science, using\ninstrumentation and techniques far more sophisticated than those\nusually encountered in standard laboratory courses.\n\nMore than 80 students are involved in undergraduate research\nprojects in chemistry each year. Although successful completion of\nan undergraduate research project is a requirement for graduation\nwith honors or highest honors (see above), it is not necessary to be a\nparticipant in Honors Carolina to undertake a research project.\n\nThe usual mechanism for becoming involved in a research project is\nto register for CHEM\u00a0395. This process begins well in advance of a\npreregistration or registration period with a visit to the Chemistry Student\nServices office, where a student may obtain a list of undergraduate\nresearch opportunities and a form titled Request for Registration in\nCHEM\u00a0395.\n\nMost students begin research during the spring semester of their junior\nyear and continue throughout their senior year. CHEM\u00a0395 and CHEM\u00a0396\ntogether may be taken for credit as many times as desired but may be\ncounted for no more than nine hours total credit toward graduation in\neither the B.A. or B.S. traditional and polymer tracks and for no more than\nsix hours in the B.S. biochemistry track. In the B.S. curriculum CHEM 395\nmay be counted no more than once as an advanced chemistry elective.\nUNC\u2013BEST\nThe UNC Baccalaureate Education in Science and Teaching (UNC\u2013BEST)\nProgram is a collaboration between the School of Education and the\nCollege of Arts and Sciences and is designed to allow undergraduate\nscience majors interested in teaching high school science the\nopportunity to earn their science degree and obtain licensure as a North\nCarolina high school science teacher in four years. UNC\u2013BEST students\nmeet all the degree requirements for their chemistry degree using\nCHEM\u00a0410 as one of their upper-level chemistry courses. UNC\u2013BEST\n\n\fstudents also fulfill teaching licensure coursework requirements as well\nas many General Education and elective requirements as they complete\n10 credit hours in teaching and learning, including EDUC\u00a0516 or EDUC\u00a0689\nor EDUC\u00a0690, EDUC\u00a0532, and EDUC\u00a0615. During their final semester\nstudents engage in a full-time student teaching internship (EDUC\u00a0593)\nand participate in an education leadership seminar (EDUC\u00a0601).

An approved learning contract is required, and\nstudents must be registered no later than the end of the first week of\nclasses.\nUndergraduate Awards\nExcellent performances by undergraduates in chemistry are recognized\nby the department through the following awards:\n\n\u2022 Francis P. Venable Medal: A medallion and cash award are presented\n\nto the two most outstanding graduating seniors majoring in\nchemistry in honor of Dr. Francis P. Venable, who was chair of the\ndepartment, president of the University from 1900 to 1914, and\npresident of the American Chemical Society.\n\nUniversity of North Carolina at Chapel Hill \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  307\n\n\u2022 Emmett Gladstone Rand Premedical Scholarship: A scholarship is\n\npresented to an exceptionally talented graduating senior intending to\npursue a career in medicine.\n\n\u2022 Jason D. Altom Memorial Award for Undergraduate Research: This\n\ncash award recognizes research potential of an undergraduate\nchemistry major.\n\n\u2022 J. Thurman Freeze Scholarship: This scholarship serves to fund\nsummer research between a student\u2019s junior and senior years.\n\u2022 E.C. Markham Summer Research Fund: The department chair\n\nselects the recipient of this award, who will use the salary to perform\nresearch between the junior and senior years.\n\n\u2022 Carrie Largent Award for Research Excellence: This award is given\n\nannually to a graduating senior who has excelled in research.\n\n\u2022 David L. Stern Scholar: Top students from upper-division laboratory\n\ncourses are chosen for this cash award.\n\n\u2022 AXE Sophomore Chemist Award: A cash award and certificate are\n\npresented to an outstanding sophomore chemistry major.\n\u2022 James H. Maguire Memorial Award: This award goes to an\n\noutstanding and academically gifted junior honors student majoring\nin chemistry.\n\n\u2022 Tanya R. Ellison Scholarship: A female, junior or senior B.S. chemistry\n\nmajor is selected for this cash award on the basis of character and\nacademic commitment.\n\n\u2022 Hypercube Scholar Award: An outstanding senior majoring in\n\nchemistry is given this chemical software package.\n\nUndergraduate Research\nAlmost every undergraduate chemistry major who has undertaken a\nresearch project has found it to be an exciting and rewarding experience.\nThe reasons are many. One certainly is that it affords an opportunity\nto make pioneering discoveries at the forefront of science, using\ninstrumentation and techniques far more sophisticated than those\nusually encountered in standard laboratory courses.\n\nMore than 80 students are involved in undergraduate research\nprojects in chemistry each year. Although successful completion of\nan undergraduate research project is a requirement for graduation\nwith honors or highest honors (see above), it is not necessary to be a\nparticipant in Honors Carolina to undertake a research project.\n\nThe usual mechanism for becoming involved in a research project is\nto register for CHEM\u00a0395. This process begins well in advance of a\npreregistration or registration period with a visit to the Chemistry Student\nServices office, where a student may obtain a list of undergraduate\nresearch opportunities and a form titled Request for Registration in\nCHEM\u00a0395.\n\nMost students begin research during the spring semester of their junior\nyear and continue throughout their senior year. CHEM\u00a0395 and CHEM\u00a0396\ntogether may be taken for credit as many times as desired but may be\ncounted for no more than nine hours total credit toward graduation in\neither the B.A. or B.S. traditional and polymer tracks and for no more than\nsix hours in the B.S. biochemistry track. In the B.S. curriculum CHEM 395\nmay be counted no more than once as an advanced chemistry elective.\nUNC\u2013BEST\nThe UNC Baccalaureate Education in Science and Teaching (UNC\u2013BEST)\nProgram is a collaboration between the School of Education and the\nCollege of Arts and Sciences and is designed to allow undergraduate\nscience majors interested in teaching high school science the\nopportunity to earn their science degree and obtain licensure as a North\n\n\fThe minor in chemistry consists of the following seven courses:\n\nCHEM\u00a0102\n\nGeneral Descriptive Chemistry II H\nor\u00a0CHEM\u00a0102H General Descriptive Chemistry II\n\nCHEM\u00a0102L\nCHEM\u00a0241\n\nCHEM\u00a0241L\n\nQuantitative Chemistry Laboratory II\nModern Analytical Methods for Separation and\nCharacterization H\nLaboratory in Separations and Analytical\nCharacterization of Organic and Biological\nCompounds\n\n3\n\n1\n2\n\n1\n\nor\u00a0CHEM\u00a0245L Honors Laboratory in Separations and Analytical\n\nCHEM\u00a0261\nCHEM\u00a0262\nCHEM\u00a0262L\n\nCharacterization of Organic and Biological Compound\nIntroduction to Organic Chemistry I H\n3\nIntroduction to Organic Chemistry II H\n3\n1\nLaboratory in Organic Chemistry\n\nor\u00a0CHEM\u00a0263L Honors Laboratory in Organic Chemistry\n\nTotal Hours\n\n14\n\nH Honors version available.

Planners\nare involved, for example, in forecasting what futures may hold for a\nregion, guiding the type and location of new development, analyzing\ntransportation systems, encouraging economic development, protecting\nthe environment, mediating diverse interests, and revitalizing urban\nneighborhoods. They are involved in designing solutions to pressing\nsocietal problems such as urban sprawl, unemployment, homelessness,\nenvironmental pollution, and urban decay.\n\nCity and regional planners work for a variety of public and private\norganizations. In the public sector local, state, and federal governments\nall employ city and regional planners. In the private sector, planners work\nfor development companies, consulting firms, and a variety of nonprofit\norganizations.\n\nFor undergraduates the Department of City and Regional Planning offers\nbasic coursework, opportunities for supervised practical experience,\nand an academic minor. Undergraduate students take courses in the\ndepartment for several reasons: to learn about cities and planning\nprocesses, to enrich or expand their current area of interest in different\naspects of urbanization, or to explore the possibility of graduate work\nleading to a career in planning. Planning courses allow students to see\nhow the arts and sciences can be applied to improve the prosperity and\nlivability of cities, towns, and rural areas. In this way they help students\ndeepen their appreciation of their major field of study. Some planning\ncourses may fulfill General Education requirements.\n\nAdvising\n\nThe department\u2019s director of dual-degree and undergraduate programs\nserves as the primary point of contact for students participating in the\nminor (see contact information above). Student advising and approval of\nequivalent courses are handled through the director. Students also have\na primary academic advisor in Steele Building.\n\nFacilities\n\nThe Department of City and Regional Planning is located in New East\nBuilding on Cameron Avenue. An important resource available to the\ndepartment is the Center for Urban and Regional Studies, located in\nHickerson House, where the research and service programs of the\ndepartment are housed. The department has strong ties to the Institute\nfor the Environment.

CLAS\u00a0691H involves\na directed reading in Greek, Latin, or archaeology in a general area\nof the student\u2019s interest and is conducted under the supervision\nof a faculty member chosen by the student to serve as the honors\nadvisor. Requirements of the course include the preparation of a thesis\nprospectus with accompanying bibliography and a preliminary oral\nexamination by the student\u2019s thesis committee. A grade for CLAS\u00a0691H\nis assigned on the basis of the total semester\u2019s work. CLAS\u00a0692H entails\nthe writing of the thesis under the direction of the honors advisor and a\nfinal oral defense before the candidate\u2019s committee. This body, in turn,\nreports its judgment to the department. If a degree with honors is to be\nawarded, a recommendation for either honors or, for particular merit,\nhighest honors is made.\nAdditional Opportunities\nThe Department of Classics supports a number of activities, including\ninformal reading groups; the local chapter of Eta Sigma Phi, the national\nundergraduate classics honorary society; and annual oral performances\nand prize competitions in reciting and translating Greek and Latin\ntexts. Several of the prize competitions involve substantial cash\nawards. Opportunities for undergraduate research include especially\nthe senior honors thesis and participation in archaeological fieldwork\nas research assistants. The department encourages majors and minors\nto take part in summer archaeological field projects; there are current\nfield projects directed or codirected by department faculty members\nand associates at Azoria in Crete and at Huqoq and Omrit in Israel.\nOther opportunities for study abroad include the programs of the\nIntercollegiate Center for Classical Studies in Rome and the College\nYear in Athens, and the exchange with King\u2019s College London. A number\nof departmental fellowships and other funding opportunities can\nhelp support participation in archaeological field projects and other\nresearch projects. Lastly, the Duke\u2013UNC Consortium for Classical and\nMediterranean Archaeology provides archaeology students access to\ncoursework, seminars, excavations and other research opportunities,\nacademic advising, and avenues for curricular and extracurricular\ninteraction across both institutions.

Through its\nteaching, research, and service, the Department of Communication\naddresses the many ways communication functions to create, sustain,\nand transform personal life, social relations, political institutions,\neconomic organizations, and cultural and aesthetic conventions in\nsociety; promotes competencies required for various modes of mediated\nand nonmediated communication; and develops skills for analyzing,\ninterpreting, and critiquing communication problems and questions.\n\nThe programs of study offered by the department thus provide a firm\nfoundation for enriched personal living, for professional effectiveness\nregardless of the specific career one may pursue, and for informed\nparticipation in the human community.\n\nAdvising\n\nDepartment advising for the major in communication studies is\nconducted by\n\n1. a full-time lecturer/advisor who holds office hours in Swain Hall and\n\nSteele Building (see the department\u2019s Web site for the advisor\u2019s office\nand office hours),\n\n2. the director of undergraduate studies for the Department of\n\nCommunication (see the department\u2019s Web site for the director\u2019s\noffice and office hours), and\n\n3. representative faculty members.\n\nFacilities\n\nThe department has extensive media production and performance\nstudies facilities located in Swain Hall and Bingham Hall. Swain Hall\nis home to state-of-the-art media production equipment, classroom\nspace, and editing suites. It also houses Studio 6, where numerous live\nperformances are staged. Bingham Hall contains the Martha Nell Hardy\nPerformance Space.\n\nGraduate School and Career Opportunities\n\nUpon completion of their degrees, students are prepared for graduate\nstudy and research in communication. Advanced study may be pursued\nin a problem-defined approach to communication research. A substantial\nnumber of graduate assistantships allow M.A.-through-Ph.D. and Ph.D.-\nonly candidates to gain experience in research, teaching, production, and\nadministration. Graduate study is characterized by intensive participation\nin seminars, original research and creative activities, and close work with\n\nUniversity of North Carolina at Chapel Hill \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  329\n\nindividual faculty members. Students are also prepared for advanced\nstudy in related academic disciplines such as law.\n\nThe career outlook for students with degrees in communication studies\nis promising, and graduates enter a variety of professions that value\ncommunication knowledge and skills. Communication studies majors are\nprepared to serve as communication specialists in business; in federal,\nstate, and local governments and agencies; and in public service. Some\nof the specific areas in which majors pursue careers are teaching, social\nadvocacy, public relations and advertising, personnel management and\ntraining, management consulting, video and film production, and work\nwith emerging technologies.\n\nAn understanding of communication provides a strong base for a range\nof career options. The mission of the department is to go beyond narrow\ntechnical training by providing a liberal arts approach to communication.\nThis provides the student with maximum latitude for promotion and\nadvancement and avoids limited career opportunities resulting from\nnarrow approaches to the field.\n\nThe burgeoning growth of communication industries and support fields\nprovides a range of career opportunities. Graduates of the department,\nwho number well over 4,000, are engaged in a variety of occupations\nranging from work for international corporations to jobs at local nonprofit\norganizations.\n\nMajors\n\n\u2022 Communication Studies Major, B.A. (p.\u00a0339)\n\u2022 Interdisciplinary Studies Major, B.A.\u2013Cultural Studies (p.\u00a0343)\n\nMinor\n\n\u2022 Writing for the Screen and Stage Minor (p.\u00a0344)\n\nGraduate Programs\n\n\u2022 M.A. in Communication Studies (http://catalog.unc.edu/graduate/\n\nschools-departments/communication)\n\n\u2022 Ph.D. in Communication Studies (http://catalog.unc.edu/graduate/\n\nschools-departments/communication)\n\nProfessors\n\nV.

Majors receive\nrigorous training in the foundations of computer science and the relevant\nmathematics, then have ample opportunity to specialize in advanced\ncourses.\n\nMajors can receive credit for practical training as a computing\nprofessional through an internship with a company or organization in the\ncomputing or information technology fields. Internships typically are paid\npositions and involve the student working off campus. All internships\nfor credit must be approved in advance by the director of undergraduate\nstudies. Students interested in pursuing such an internship should\ncontact the director of undergraduate studies prior to the start of the\ninternship.\n\nMajors who excel in the program also have the opportunity to perform\nundergraduate research in computer science. Research projects may be\npursued in conjunction with an existing graduate research group in the\ndepartment and/or may be used as a vehicle for graduating with honors\nas described below.\n\nStudents with no prior programming experience should consider taking\none of the introductory courses, COMP\u00a0110 or COMP\u00a0116. COMP\u00a0101\nis intended for students who wish to develop a better understanding of\ncomputers in a context that does not involve programming. Students\nwith prior programming experience should begin their studies with\nCOMP\u00a0401. COMP\u00a0380 and COMP\u00a0388 are philosophical and moral\nreasoning Approaches courses that have no programming prerequisite.\n\nAdvising\n\nIn addition to general advising through the Academic Advising Program,\nstudents can consult designated faculty members within the Department\nof Computer Science who act as departmental advisors for requirements\nspecific to the major or minor. Beyond course selection, advisors are\nalso available for discussing internships, study abroad in computer\nscience, honors projects, and undergraduate research opportunities.

An honors course fulfills the same\n\nrequirements as the nonhonors version of that course. Enrollment\nand GPA restrictions may apply.\n\nNotes on the Suggested Plan of Study\nA first formal course in computer programming (such as COMP\u00a0110) is\na prerequisite for COMP\u00a0401. Students with no programming experience\nshould begin their program of study with COMP\u00a0110. Students who\nare unsure if their background preparation enables them to begin their\nstudies with COMP\u00a0401 are encouraged to consult a departmental\nadvisor.\n\nStudents who are able to begin with COMP\u00a0401 may take it in their first\nsemester and either advance the suggested program of study by one\nsemester (giving themselves an extra free elective in their junior/senior\nyears) or take another appropriate course such as a first-year seminar.\nIn either case, neither COMP\u00a0110 nor a first-year seminar is a required\ncourse in the major.\n\nThis plan of study further assumes that students will place out of foreign\nlanguage 1. If this is not the case, then the student should start with\nforeign language 1 (and have one fewer free elective in the senior year).\n\nSpecial Opportunities in Computer\nScience\nHonors in Computer Science\nStudents are eligible for graduation with honors if they complete the\nfollowing requirements:\n\n\u2022 A cumulative grade point average of 3.3 or better\n\u2022 A grade point average of 3.3 or better from among the set of COMP,\n\nMATH, PHYS, and STOR courses taken to fulfill the graduation\nrequirements for the major\n\n\u2022 Graduation with honors requires the completion of two semesters\nof research (COMP\u00a0691H and COMP\u00a0692H). As part of COMP\u00a0692H,\nstudents must submit a written honors thesis and complete an\noral public presentation of the thesis. Graduation with highest\nhonors in computer science is possible for those students whose\nhonors project and thesis are judged by a faculty committee to be\nparticularly distinguished.\n\nStudents interested in pursuing honors in computer science are\nencouraged to contact the director of undergraduate studies.\nExperiential Education\nWhen arranged in advance with a supervising faculty member, COMP\u00a0293\ncan be used to earn credit for appropriate work experience in the\nsummer. COMP\u00a0293 satisfies the experiential education requirement.\nCOMP\u00a0495 and COMP\u00a0691H can also be used to satisfy the experiential\neducation requirement. Another possibility is through study abroad (see\nbelow).\nAssistantships and Internships\nIn addition to their classroom experiences, undergraduates may enhance\ntheir learning experience as research assistants or teaching assistants.\n\n\f356\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  Computer Science Minor\n\nStudents also can participate in nationally recognized research programs\nor use the department's facilities to pursue self-directed research with a\nfaculty member.\n\nWork-study students can gain valuable work experience as assistants\non the department\u2019s computer services staff. The department also\nencourages students to pursue internship experiences. Carolina\u2019s\nproximity to Research Triangle Park means that computer science majors\nhave many internship and postgraduation opportunities available in their\nown backyard.\nStudy Abroad\nStudy abroad opportunities with priority for computer science students\nare offered through University College London (UCL) and the National\nUniversity of Singapore (NUS) School of Computing.\n\nUCL can accept UNC\u2013Chapel Hill students for either a semester or\nyearlong exchange. For semester-only programs, UCL recommends\nregistering for spring semester rather than fall as it better matches their\nacademic calendar. Many courses satisfying the computer science B.S.\nrequirements can be completed at UCL. UCL is located in the heart of\nLondon and is just a few blocks away from UNC\u2013Chapel Hill\u2019s European\nStudy Center in Winston House.\n\nNUS can accept UNC\u2013Chapel Hill students for fall or spring semester, or\na yearlong exchange. This exchange allows Carolina students to enroll\ndirectly into the NUS School of Computing and choose their courses from\namong the full offering. On a case-by-case basis, students may also be\nable to take other courses at NUS outside of the School of Computing.\nStudy abroad at NUS is eligible for the Phillips Ambassadors Scholarship.\nPlease see phillips.unc.edu (http://phillips.unc.edu) for more information.\n\nSpecific course equivalences for both schools are posted on the\ndepartment\u2019s Web site. Students interested in taking a course not listed\nshould contact the director of undergraduate studies before registering\nfor courses at the school.\n\nApplication for both programs is through the University\u2019s Study Abroad\nOffice. Application to the UCL programs and the NUS fall and yearlong\nprograms takes place early in the spring of each year. Application for the\nNUS spring program takes place early in the fall of each year. Applicants\nfor exchange participation must have completed at least one year of\nstudy at UNC\u2013Chapel Hill and must have declared a computer science\nor precomputer science major. Study abroad satisfies the experiential\neducation General Education requirement of the undergraduate\ncurriculum.\nUndergraduate Awards\nThe department awards two yearly prizes to computer science majors.\nIn conjunction with SAS Institute, the department annually presents\nthe Charles H. Dunham Scholarship. The Dunham scholarship includes\na cash award to the student and a summer internship at SAS and is\nawarded in the spring semester to a student in their junior year. The\ndepartment also annually presents the Stephen F. Weiss Award for\nOutstanding Achievement in Computer Science, which includes a cash\nprize. The Weiss award is presented to a student in the fall of the senior\nyear.\n\nDual Bachelor\u2019s\u2013Master\u2019s Degree Program\n\nStudents in the B.S. degree program with a GPA of 3.2 or better after five\nor more semesters of study have the option of applying to the dual B.S.\u2013\nM.S. program at UNC\u2013Chapel Hill to pursue graduate coursework leading\n\nto the degree of master of science. Such students must complete the\nrequirements for the bachelor of science degree within eight semesters.\nUpon completion of the B.S. degree, students then enroll as a graduate\nstudent to continue work towards the master of science degree.\n\nThe requirements for the master of science degree can be found in the\nGraduate Catalog. Generally, the master\u2019s degree requires 30 additional\nhours of computer science coursework. Up to nine credit hours of\ncomputer science coursework taken while an undergraduate can be\napplied to the master\u2019s degree if the coursework is not also used to\nsatisfy the graduation requirements for the bachelor\u2019s degree. The\nrequirements for the master\u2019s can be completed in as few as two\nadditional semesters, for a total of 10 semesters of study.\n\nStudents interested in the dual-degree program should have completed\n(or be on track to complete) seven computer science courses at the\n400 level or higher by the end of their sixth semester. Students must\nformally apply for admission to the combined B.S.\u2013M.S. program, and it\nis expected that the application process would take place in the student\u2019s\nsixth semester. Students applying in their sixth semester of study will\nbe notified of the outcome of their application by the end of their sixth\nsemester.\n\nStudents interested in the dual-degree program are strongly advised\nto consult the director of undergraduate studies in the Department of\nComputer Science in their sophomore year to discuss eligibility and an\nappropriate plan of study.\n\nComputer Science Minor\nContact Information\nDepartment of Computer Science\nhttp://www.cs.unc.edu\nBrooks Computer Science Building, 201 S.

CONWAY, Chair\n\nIntroduction\n\nEconomics is commonly defined as the study of how society allocates\nscarce resources to satisfy unlimited wants. It focuses upon the fact that\nwe wish to maximize our satisfaction through the consumption of goods\nand services (including leisure time); however, the resources available for\nproduction are limited. Hence, decisions must be made regarding what\nto produce, how to produce it most efficiently, and how to distribute the\noutput among the various members of the society. Economics analyzes\nthe market framework for making such choices.\n\nAt the microeconomic or \u201cindividual unit\u201d level, economics examines the\nbehavior of consumers, business firms, workers, and individual markets.\nAt the macroeconomic or \u201caggregate\u201d level, attention is given to the\nnational and international problems of unemployment, inflation, balance\nof payments, and economic growth.\n\nThe courses leading to a B.A. degree with a major in economics comprise\na large area of inquiry into the problems and structure of the economic\nsegment of society. The curriculum provides the opportunity to achieve\none or more of the following objectives:\n\nUniversity of North Carolina at Chapel Hill \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  369\n\ngraduate school. Further information on courses, undergraduate research\nopportunities, the honors program, careers, and graduate schools may be\nobtained from the department\u2019s Web site.\n\nGraduate School and Career Opportunities\n\nEconomics students in recent years have frequently pursued graduate\nwork in law and business administration, as well as the Ph.D. degree\nin economics. Others have entered international affairs/international\nstudies programs. Students planning to pursue graduate work in\neconomics should continue to take mathematics courses beyond\nthe required level, and a minor or second major in mathematics is\nrecommended.\n\nMost students have accepted employment with commercial and\ninvestment banks, accounting and insurance firms, and a variety of other\ncorporations. The economics major competes well with other majors\n(including business administration) in the job market. Employment\nsurveys of recent graduates by UNC\u2013Chapel Hill\u2019s University Career\nServices indicate a relatively high ranking for economics majors in terms\nof employment rates and starting salaries. Note: Recent majors have\nfound that job possibilities are enhanced if at least one accounting\ncourse has been completed at the undergraduate level.\n\nMajor\n\n\u2022 Economics Major, B.A. (p.\u00a0375)\n\nMinor\n\n\u2022 Entrepreneurship Minor (p.\u00a0376)\n\nGraduate Programs\n\n\u2022 M.S. in Economics (http://catalog.unc.edu/graduate/schools-\n\ndepartments/economics)\n\n\u2022 Ph.D. in Economics (http://catalog.unc.edu/graduate/schools-\n\ndepartments/economics)\n\nProfessors\n\nGary A.

Each candidate\nformulates an honors thesis proposal and initiates work on the project.\nIn ECON\u00a0692H, the thesis work is conducted under the supervision of\na faculty advisor who is a specialist in the general topic area of the\nresearch.\n\nNear the end of the second semester (ECON\u00a0692H), the student stands\nfor an oral examination on the thesis. Upon successful completion of the\nprogram, the student receives the bachelor of arts degree with honors or\nwith highest honors. Students in the honors program are also required to\ncomplete at least an eight-course major rather than the minimum seven\ncourses, including ECON\u00a0691H and ECON\u00a0692H.\nDepartmental Involvement\nUndergraduates in economics have organized an active club, the Carolina\nEconomics Club. Seminars, social activities, and greater interaction\namong students and with faculty have resulted from the formation of\nthis on-going organization. The Club also has helped the Department\nof Economics conduct an annual job fair. All majors are invited to\nparticipate in this organization\u2019s activities. In addition, the local chapter\nof Omicron Delta Epsilon, the national economics honor society, annually\nextends membership to those outstanding junior and senior economics\nmajors who have demonstrated strong academic performance both\noverall and in their economics courses.\nUndergraduate Awards\nEach spring the Chancellor awards the Undergraduate Prize in Economics\nto the undergraduate student majoring in economics who has been\njudged the most outstanding on the basis of major and related course\nperformances.\n\nEntrepreneurship Minor\nContact Information\n\nDepartment of Economics\nhttp://econ.unc.edu\n107 Gardner Hall, CB# 3305\n(919) 966-2383\n\nRita Balaban, Director of Undergraduate Studies (spring 2017)\n\n\fUniversity of North Carolina at Chapel Hill \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  377\n\nH Honors version available.

Our course offerings present\na diversity of approaches to the study, production, and appreciation of\nliterary and nonliterary texts. In our undergraduate program, we pursue a\nfour-fold mission to\n\nevaluate, and promote, in clear and forceful language, new ideas as well\nas civilizing influences of a shared past or an increasingly global present.\n\nMajors\n\n\u2022 Comparative Literature Major, B.A. (p.\u00a0404)\n\u2022 English Major, B.A. (p.\u00a0409)\n\nMinors\n\n\u2022 Comparative Literature Minor (p.\u00a0412)\n\u2022 Composition, Rhetoric, and Digital Literacy Minor (p.\u00a0413)\n\u2022 Creative Writing Minor (p.\u00a0414)\n\u2022 English Minor (p.\u00a0416)\n\u2022 Global Cinema Minor (p.\u00a0417)\n\u2022 Latina/o Studies Minor (p.\u00a0418)\n\u2022 Medicine, Literature, and Culture Minor (p.\u00a0419)\n\nGraduate Programs\n\n\u2022 M.A. in Comparative Literature (http://catalog.unc.edu/graduate/\n\nschools-departments/english-comparative-literature)\n\n\u2022 Ph.D. in Comparative Literature (http://catalog.unc.edu/graduate/\n\nschools-departments/english-comparative-literature)\n\n1. explore the history and significance of American, British, and world\n\n\u2022 M.A. in English (http://catalog.unc.edu/graduate/schools-\n\nliteratures;\n\ndepartments/english-comparative-literature)\n\n2. promote interdisciplinary connections and incorporate the study of\n\n\u2022 Ph.D. in English (http://catalog.unc.edu/graduate/schools-\n\nculture, theory, and history into our research and courses;\n\ndepartments/english-comparative-literature)\n\n3. offer training in rigorous thinking, precise analysis, and critical\n\nreading; and\n\n4. foster practical skills in rhetoric, composition, and expression in\n\nessays, creative pieces, even emerging forms of digital media.\n\nAdvising\n\nBecause the major in comparative literature is a relatively small major,\nstudents and faculty members have the opportunity for frequent\ndiscussions. Majors should expect to work closely with the director\nof undergraduate studies and other faculty members in comparative\nliterature to design and follow a coherent and cohesive plan of study in\nthe major, as well as to consider options for independent research, study\nabroad, and honors thesis opportunities. Students are expected to review\ntheir Tar Heel Tracker each semester and work with advisors in Steele\nBuilding to ensure timely progress towards the degree.\n\nAll English majors have a primary academic advisor in Steele Building.\nStudents are strongly encouraged to meet regularly with their advisor and\nreview their Tar Heel Tracker each semester. The department\u2019s director\nof undergraduate studies works with current and prospective majors by\nappointment. Departmental academic advising is particularly important\nfor those majors who are considering going on to graduate school.\nFurther information on courses, undergraduate research opportunities,\nthe honors program, careers, and graduate schools may be obtained from\nthe department\u2019s Web site.\n\nGraduate School and Career Opportunities\n\nMajors in English and comparative literature provide essential\npreparation for numerous career paths in business and government\nas well as in education, the law, and medicine.

Students who study\nabroad can generally apply their literature credits towards the major.\nStudents completing the global cinema studies track may not complete a\nminor in global cinema studies.\n\nAll majors, regardless of their chosen track, must obtain at least a level\n4 proficiency in a foreign language relevant to their individual area of\ninterest. We strongly recommend that students in the global cinema\nstudies track study as many film courses in the original languages as\npossible.\n\nSophomores planning to major in comparative literature should take\none course under the Great Books I rubric, which treats ancient and\npremodern literatures, and one course under the Great Books II rubric,\nwhich treats literature from 1750 to the present. One of these courses\ncan be used to fulfill the General Education literary arts Approaches\nrequirement.\n\nSpecial Opportunities in English and\nComparative Literature\nHonors in Comparative Literature\nMajors with an overall 3.3 grade point average may elect to write an\nhonors thesis by applying for permission to the director of undergraduate\nstudies in the spring semester of their junior year. Students then register\nfor CMPL\u00a0691H and CMPL\u00a0692H during their senior year. These courses\nmay count as credit towards completion of the major. Students write\nthe 50- to 70-page thesis on a comparative topic under the direction\nof any faculty member. The student conducts independent research\nduring the summer between junior and senior years, often with the\nassistance of research funding. The first semester of the senior year\ninvolves regular tutorial sessions with the faculty advisor, as well as the\ncompletion of most of the writing of the thesis. In the spring students\nfinish the process of writing and defend the completed thesis at an\noral examination. For more information about the honors thesis in\ncomparative literature, including examples of past thesis topics, please\nvisit the English and Comparative Literature Honors Thesis Web site\n(http://englishcomplit.unc.edu/complit/undergraduate/honors_thesis).\nHonors in Creative Writing\nSee \u201cCreative Writing Minor (p.\u00a0414).\"\nHonors in English\nThe Department offers at least two English honors seminars each\nsemester. In addition, students seeking a degree with honors in English\n(a 3.3 cumulative grade point average and a 3.6 grade point average in\nmajor courses required) undertake a yearlong independent project during\n\n\ftheir senior year (ENGL\u00a0691H and ENGL\u00a0692H) and usually produce a\n40- to 50-page thesis. Students pursuing a degree with honors normally\nmeet every week with the professors supervising their projects. This\nopportunity for individually directed research and writing often proves to\nbe a high point of the student\u2019s academic career.\nStudy Abroad\nSome of the best programs offered at the University for study overseas\nare especially appropriate and useful to majors in the Department of\nEnglish and Comparative Literature. These include semester or yearlong\nprograms at Bristol, Manchester, Sussex, Edinburgh, Glasgow, and certain\nAustralian universities. Students who have a minimum grade point\naverage of 3.3 at the end of their sophomore year can participate in the\nKing\u2019s College Exchange Program at King\u2019s College, London (representing\neither English or comparative literature). Special opportunities are also\navailable at Oxford University and through the Joint Degree Program\nwith the National University of Singapore. Comparative literature\nstudents most frequently travel to non-English-speaking destinations. For\ninformation on all overseas programs, see the Study Abroad Office or visit\ntheir Web site (http://studyabroad.unc.edu).\n\nEnglish Major, B.A.\nContact Information\nDepartment of English and Comparative Literature\nhttp://englishcomplit.unc.edu\nGreenlaw Hall, CB# 3520\n(919) 962-5481\n\nDr. Eliza Richards, Director of Undergraduate Studies\necr@email.unc.edu\n\nDr. Hilary Lithgow, Lecturer-Advisor\nlithgow@email.unc.edu\n\nThe major in English equips students to become incisive thinkers\nand powerful writers. At UNC, English majors develop these skills by\nlearning to analyze a range of literary genres and cultural artifacts: from\nbroadsides and books to digital archives and mp3s; from poetry and the\nnovel to dramatic performance and film. The B.A. with a major in English\nforegrounds the inventive ways that individuals from various historical\nand cultural settings have engaged writing and artistic representation to\nunderstand\u2014and remake\u2014the world around them.\n\nThe core curriculum of the English major offers students a\ncomprehensive overview of the history of English-language literature and\nthought, from their beginnings in the Middle Ages to the contemporary\nrise of English as a global language. The core also features introductory\ncourses, which impart analytical, research, and writing skills that help\nstudents explore the relevance of literature and other media to questions\nof history, culture, and everyday life.\n\nThe B.A. launches English majors into a digital, global world with\nhistorical knowledge about what has shaped it. Because rigorous\nanalysis of literary documents requires sensitivity to the context of\ntheir production, students who major in English enter this increasingly\ntechnological and transnational world with a crucial skill: the ability to\nthink contextually.

Students then register\nfor CMPL\u00a0691H and CMPL\u00a0692H during their senior year. These courses\nmay count as credit towards completion of the major. Students write\n\n\f412\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  Comparative Literature Minor\n\nthe 50- to 70-page thesis on a comparative topic under the direction\nof any faculty member. The student conducts independent research\nduring the summer between junior and senior years, often with the\nassistance of research funding. The first semester of the senior year\ninvolves regular tutorial sessions with the faculty advisor, as well as the\ncompletion of most of the writing of the thesis. In the spring students\nfinish the process of writing and defend the completed thesis at an\noral examination. For more information about the honors thesis in\ncomparative literature, including examples of past thesis topics, please\nvisit the English and Comparative Literature Honors Thesis Web site\n(http://englishcomplit.unc.edu/complit/undergraduate/honors_thesis).\nHonors in Creative Writing\nSee \u201cCreative Writing Minor (p.\u00a0414).\"\nHonors in English\nThe Department offers at least two English honors seminars each\nsemester. In addition, students seeking a degree with honors in English\n(a 3.3 cumulative grade point average and a 3.6 grade point average in\nmajor courses required) undertake a yearlong independent project during\ntheir senior year (ENGL\u00a0691H and ENGL\u00a0692H) and usually produce a\n40- to 50-page thesis. Students pursuing a degree with honors normally\nmeet every week with the professors supervising their projects. This\nopportunity for individually directed research and writing often proves to\nbe a high point of the student\u2019s academic career.\nStudy Abroad\nSome of the best programs offered at the University for study overseas\nare especially appropriate and useful to majors in the Department of\nEnglish and Comparative Literature. These include semester or yearlong\nprograms at Bristol, Manchester, Sussex, Edinburgh, Glasgow, and certain\nAustralian universities. Students who have a minimum grade point\naverage of 3.3 at the end of their sophomore year can participate in the\nKing\u2019s College Exchange Program at King\u2019s College, London (representing\neither English or comparative literature). Special opportunities are also\navailable at Oxford University and through the Joint Degree Program\nwith the National University of Singapore.

Please always review summer session course\nlistings for any changes or updates.\n\nAdvancement to successive courses in either the fiction or poetry\nsequence is by recommendation of the student\u2019s previous instructor(s)\nand by application for both the advanced workshops and senior honors\nseminars. If possible, the student is assigned to a different instructor\nfor each course. Should students not advance beyond the intermediate\nlevel, they may choose to finish the minor with other classes offered in\ncreative writing. Creative writing minors receive priority in all creative\nwriting classes and usually fill all seats.\n\nStudents completing the five courses for the minor may take additional\ncreative writing courses only by permission of the director, providing that\nall other students still completing the minor are served first.\n\nAgain, please note that online courses do not count towards the creative\nwriting minor.\nTransfer Students: Important Information\nThe requirement for taking a minor in creative writing is five courses or 15\nsemester hours. Students are limited to one creative writing course per\nsemester. Most junior transfer students have four semesters remaining.\nJunior transfer students wanting to minor in creative writing must either\n\n1. Have an introductory course already on their record that will transfer\n\nto Carolina as credit, e.g., an introductory course in fiction writing\nor poetry writing taken previously at a college or university that is\ntransferring in as credit for ENGL\u00a0130 or ENGL\u00a0131; OR\n\n2. Take an introductory course via UNC\u2013Chapel Hill Summer School\nprior to their first fall term at Carolina and be promoted to the next\nlevel or to another creative writing class (on a space-available basis)\nin the fall of their junior year.\n\nPermission to move forward with transfer credit for an introductory\ncourse requirement (Option 1 above) will require a review by the creative\n\n\f416\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  English Minor\n\nwriting faculty of the syllabus and work completed in the course and is\ndependent on space availability, which cannot be guaranteed. Students\nmust provide hard copies of syllabi and samples of coursework as early\nas possible in order to ensure time for review and to schedule a meeting\nwith the director.\n\nJunior transfer students fulfilling one of these two options would be\neligible for Advanced Fiction or Poetry (ENGL\u00a0406 or ENGL\u00a0407) and the\nsenior honors seminars (ENGL\u00a0693H and ENGL\u00a0694H) if there is space\navailable in Intermediate Fiction (ENGL\u00a0206) or Intermediate Poetry\n(ENGL\u00a0207) their first fall semester, and if\u2014on the basis of submitted\nwork reviewed by a committee\u2014they are chosen for those classes. If not,\nthey would need to complete the minor using the multigenre approach.\n\nNote: No more than two creative writing courses from other schools may be\ncounted for credit at UNC\u2013Chapel Hill. At least three of the five courses taken\nfor the minor\u2014courses designated ENGL\u2014must be Creative Writing Program\ncourses taken at Carolina.\n\nHonors in Creating Writing\n\nTo qualify for a degree with honors or highest honors in creative\nwriting, students must maintain a 3.3 grade point average and meet all\nrequirements both to enter and to complete the senior honors seminar\n(ENGL\u00a0693H and ENGL\u00a0694H).\n\nSee program page here (p.\u00a0411) for additional special opportunities.\n\nEnglish Minor\nContact Information\nDepartment of English and Comparative Literature\nhttp://englishcomplit.unc.edu\nGreenlaw Hall, CB# 3520\n(919) 962-5481\n\nDr. Eliza Richards, Director of Undergraduate Studies\necr@email.unc.edu\n\nDr. Hilary Lithgow, Lecturer-Advisor\nlithgow@email.unc.edu\n\nThe Department of English and Comparative Literature is a vibrant and\ndiverse department with a global reach.

Latinas/os are defined as people of Latin American and Iberian\ndescent living and working or based in the United States, but also moving\nbetween the United States and the rest of the Americas. Latina/o studies\ntakes as its primary concern the presence of Latin America, Spain, and\nthe myriad combinations of Hispanic-Native-African-Asian and European\nnon-Hispanic cultures within the borders of the United States. However,\nLatina/o studies is not confined within those borders to the extent that its\nsubjects of study (and the very creators of the field itself) are in motion\nand in flux, coming and going, crossing borders and boundaries. In this\nrespect it shares some of the transnational and transcultural scope,\nmomentum, and issues of Latin American studies but with its own foci,\nits own perspectives. Latina/o studies does not duplicate the work of\nLatin American studies; it draws on it and complements it.\n\nLatina/o studies encompasses Chicana/o studies, Puerto Rican studies,\nCuban American studies, Dominican studies, Central American studies,\nSouth American studies, and so forth. It takes into account the cultural\nproduction and the socioeconomic and political experiences of a diverse\npopulation located in many parts of the country, not just in the Southwest\nborderlands.\n\nThe main stipulation of the minor is that students must take a\ncombination of courses in the humanities (literatures and cultural\nproduction) and the social sciences (communities and cultural space),\nsome of which have been designated as core courses and others as\nelectives.

CABLE, Chair\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe Curriculum for the Environment and Ecology offers diverse and\nmultidisciplinary undergraduate degree programs in environmental\nscience (B.S.) and environmental studies (B.A.). Faculty throughout the\nUniversity, including the College of Arts and Sciences and the schools of\nbusiness, government, law, and public health, mentor students through\ncourses, internships, and research opportunities. This unique approach\nprovides students an opportunity to explore the knowledge base needed\nto understand the environment and its relationship to society, as well\nas the applications of that knowledge in areas such as environmental\nmodeling; aquatic systems; environmental behavior and decisions;\nenvironmental change and human health; ecology, conservation, and\nbiodiversity; and population and the environment. The degrees combine\ntraditional classroom teaching with extensive use of interdisciplinary,\nteam-based projects, internships, study abroad opportunities, and\nresearch.\n\nAdvising\n\nThe Curriculum for the Environment and Ecology maintains an advising\nsystem for students with an environmental interest. Students are\nencouraged to contact the director of undergraduate studies as early as\nthey wish in their academic plan to discuss options and be assigned to a\nfaculty advisor. Students may use the advising system from the time they\nenter UNC\u2013Chapel Hill, obtaining advice from specialists in the various\nenvironmental fields. This advising system includes opportunities to\nmeet with professionals from government, industry, and consulting to\nlearn about the skills needed to work effectively in those fields if students\nare interested. In addition we routinely schedule seminars and host\nvisitors who showcase career opportunities by their example in their\nrespective fields.\n\nFacilities\n\nCurriculum faculty members and staff occupy offices and laboratories in\nVenable/Murray Halls (third floor) and the facilities in Manteo, Morehead\nCity, and Highlands, NC.\n\nGraduate School and Career Opportunities\n\nA major in environmental science or studies prepares students for\na variety of career options, including marine scientist, ecologist,\nenvironmental modeler, environmental policy maker, conservation\nadvocate, land use planner, and environmental educator.

Environmental and Science Communication (esc.web.unc.edu (http://\n\nesc.web.unc.edu)) is a collaboration between Environment and\nEcology and the School of Media and Journalism; and\n\n2. Environmental Informatics (dualesis.web.unc.edu (http://\n\ndualesis.web.unc.edu)) is a collaboration between Environment and\nEcology and the School of Information and Library Sciences.\n\nEach program is designed for students to earn their bachelor\u2019s degree\nand complete a master\u2019s degree in a professional school in as little as\nfive years. The dual degree in environmental and science communication\nis approached through the bachelor\u2019s of arts degree with a major in\nenvironmental studies, and students then complete a master\u2019s degree in\njournalism. The dual degree in environmental informatics is approached\n\nUniversity of North Carolina at Chapel Hill \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  435\n\nthrough the bachelor\u2019s of science degree with a major in environmental\nscience, and students then complete a master\u2019s in information sciences.\n\nFor the environmental science communication program, students\nmust complete the undergraduate requirements for the B.A. degree in\nenvironmental studies and the graduate requirements for the M.A. degree\nin mass communication as separate degrees. For the environmental\ninformatics program, students must complete the undergraduate\nrequirements for the B.S. degree in environmental sciences and the\ngraduate requirements for the M.S.I.S. degree in information sciences as\nseparate degrees. Students may begin taking courses for the graduate\ndegree while in the undergraduate program, and a limited number of\ncredit hours of approved graduate coursework may be transferred\ninto the graduate degree program in mass communication (up to nine\nhours) and information sciences (up to 12 hours). Courses taken as an\nundergraduate for graduate credit may not be counted as part of the\nundergraduate degree if the intent is to transfer them to the graduate\nprogram. Early advising is essential to success in navigating these dual-\ndegree programs. Advisors are available in both units to help students\nprepare and select courses appropriately to get the most from their\neducation.\n\nApplying for the dual-degree program is a two-step process. It is highly\nrecommend that interested first- and second-year students speak\nto an advisor early in their college program. Students must submit a\nconditional application to the program no later than their junior year\nto ensure that they will receive preference in registering for courses.\nStudents must formally apply to the program through The Graduate\nSchool in their senior year. The GRE is not required for applications\nfrom current UNC\u2013Chapel Hill students. For complete information on\nthe application process and curriculum requirements, please go to\nesc.web.unc.edu (http://esc.web.unc.edu).\n\nSpecial Opportunities in Environmental\nScience and Studies\nHonors in Environmental Science or Studies\nStudents in either the B.S. or B.A. degree program may participate\nin honors research leading to graduation with honors or highest\nhonors. This distinction is earned by participation in honors research\n(ENEC\u00a0693H) and culminates in ENEC\u00a0694H, thesis writing and defense.\nStudents should follow the guidelines established by Honors Carolina\nand meet with the faculty honors advisor, Dr. Geoff Bell, to ensure that\nappropriate requirements are fulfilled (Requirements can be found on\nthe Honors Program Web site (http://honorscarolina.unc.edu/current-\nstudents/honors-thesis-and-undergraduate-research/honors-thesis)).\nHonors students can use three credit hours of ENEC\u00a0693H (research)\nor ENEC\u00a0694H (thesis), but not both courses, to fulfill a concentration\nrequirement.\nDepartmental Involvement\nThe Carolina Environmental Student Alliance (CESA) is an\ninterdisciplinary organization dedicated to uniting the environmental\ninterests of students across campus. Participation is open to all students\nand community members with an interest in the environment. The\nEpsilon Eta Environmental Honors Fraternity is an organization dedicated\nto excellence in environmental education. Interested students are\nnominated for membership.\nExperiential Education\nPossibilities for experiential education include APPLES service-learning\ncourses (ENEC\u00a0593), Coral Reef Ecology and Management (ENEC\u00a0259),\n\n\f436\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  Environmental Science, B.S.\n\nSierra Nevada Program (ENEC\u00a0208), internships (ENEC\u00a0393, ENEC\u00a0493),\nresearch (ENEC\u00a0395, ENEC\u00a0396, ENEC\u00a0698), and honors research\n(ENEC\u00a0693H, ENEC\u00a0694H). Additionally, a series of experiential education\nfield sites is available in North Carolina and around the world where\nstudents may take coursework and conduct research for a semester. Fall\nsemester field sites are offered in North Carolina at Highlands Biological\nStation (mountain/ecology), the Institute for Marine Sciences (marine\necology/geology), and the Coastal Studies Institute/Outer Banks (coastal\npolicy and economics). Spring semester field sites are offered on the\nUNC campus (Sustainable Triangle field site), in Thailand (energy and\npollution), and Ecuador (ecology or sustainable development). The\nEcuador and Thailand field site experiences incorporate part of the\nfollowing summer as well. Summer programs are offered at Cambridge,\nEngland (energy policy), and in the Galapagos (ecology). Contact our\nadvisors about other opportunities. Faculty members often arrange\nBurch Program summer educational trips to such locations as Siberia,\nRussia (ecology and anthropology), the Sierra Nevadas (ecology and\nphysical geography), and northern Europe (energy, sustainability, and\ncommunication).\nInternships\nStudents are encouraged to apply for paid or unpaid internships in\nlocal, state, national, and international environmental organizations.\nInternship opportunities can be found through the environmental\ninternships website (http://environmentalinternships.web.unc.edu).\nThese internships provide valuable practical experience, and some may\nbe conducted for academic credit.\nStudy Abroad\nExchange and other study abroad programs are available through the\nUNC Study Abroad Office. At some locations students may take courses\nfor UNC credit, such as some field sites listed above. Students may take\ncourses at other universities during study abroad and apply for transfer\ncredit as well. We encourage students to participate in study abroad\nduring their career at Carolina.\nUndergraduate Awards\nUndergraduates may be considered for the Watts and Betsy Carr Awards,\nMary and Watts Hill Jr. Awards, and Robert Alonzo Winston Scholarships.\nUndergraduate Research\nAll students are encouraged (but not required) to complete an\nindependent or team research project. Such projects introduce students\nto the tools needed for graduate study. They also provide an important\nopportunity for working directly with the world-class environmental\nfaculty members and graduate students at UNC\u2013Chapel Hill, as well as\nin the many environmental organizations in the Research Triangle. The\nTriangle area contains one of the largest collections of environmental\norganizations and expertise in the world, providing unique opportunities\nfor students to conduct research on an immense range of topics from\nfundamental scientific research to policy applications.\n\nEnvironmental Science, B.S.\nContact Information\n\nCurriculum for the Environment and Ecology\nhttp://www.cee.unc.edu\n3301 Venable Hall, CB# 3275\n(919) 962-1270\n\nAmy E.

An honors course fulfills the same\n\nrequirements as the nonhonors version of that course. Enrollment\nand GPA restrictions may apply.\n\nSpecial Opportunities in Environmental\nScience and Studies\nHonors in Environmental Science or Studies\nStudents in either the B.S. or B.A. degree program may participate\nin honors research leading to graduation with honors or highest\nhonors. This distinction is earned by participation in honors research\n(ENEC\u00a0693H) and culminates in ENEC\u00a0694H, thesis writing and defense.\nStudents should follow the guidelines established by Honors Carolina\nand meet with the faculty honors advisor, Dr. Geoff Bell, to ensure that\nappropriate requirements are fulfilled (Requirements can be found on\nthe Honors Program Web site (http://honorscarolina.unc.edu/current-\nstudents/honors-thesis-and-undergraduate-research/honors-thesis)).\nHonors students can use three credit hours of ENEC\u00a0693H (research)\nor ENEC\u00a0694H (thesis), but not both courses, to fulfill a concentration\nrequirement.\nDepartmental Involvement\nThe Carolina Environmental Student Alliance (CESA) is an\ninterdisciplinary organization dedicated to uniting the environmental\ninterests of students across campus. Participation is open to all students\nand community members with an interest in the environment. The\nEpsilon Eta Environmental Honors Fraternity is an organization dedicated\nto excellence in environmental education. Interested students are\nnominated for membership.\nExperiential Education\nPossibilities for experiential education include APPLES service-learning\ncourses (ENEC\u00a0593), Coral Reef Ecology and Management (ENEC\u00a0259),\nSierra Nevada Program (ENEC\u00a0208), internships (ENEC\u00a0393, ENEC\u00a0493),\nresearch (ENEC\u00a0395, ENEC\u00a0396, ENEC\u00a0698), and honors research\n(ENEC\u00a0693H, ENEC\u00a0694H). Additionally, a series of experiential education\nfield sites is available in North Carolina and around the world where\nstudents may take coursework and conduct research for a semester. Fall\nsemester field sites are offered in North Carolina at Highlands Biological\nStation (mountain/ecology), the Institute for Marine Sciences (marine\necology/geology), and the Coastal Studies Institute/Outer Banks (coastal\npolicy and economics). Spring semester field sites are offered on the\nUNC campus (Sustainable Triangle field site), in Thailand (energy and\npollution), and Ecuador (ecology or sustainable development). The\nEcuador and Thailand field site experiences incorporate part of the\nfollowing summer as well. Summer programs are offered at Cambridge,\nEngland (energy policy), and in the Galapagos (ecology). Contact our\nadvisors about other opportunities. Faculty members often arrange\nBurch Program summer educational trips to such locations as Siberia,\nRussia (ecology and anthropology), the Sierra Nevadas (ecology and\nphysical geography), and northern Europe (energy, sustainability, and\ncommunication).\nInternships\nStudents are encouraged to apply for paid or unpaid internships in\nlocal, state, national, and international environmental organizations.\nInternship opportunities can be found through the environmental\ninternships website (http://environmentalinternships.web.unc.edu).\nThese internships provide valuable practical experience, and some may\nbe conducted for academic credit.\n\nStudy Abroad\nExchange and other study abroad programs are available through the\nUNC Study Abroad Office. At some locations students may take courses\nfor UNC credit, such as some field sites listed above. Students may take\ncourses at other universities during study abroad and apply for transfer\ncredit as well. We encourage students to participate in study abroad\nduring their career at Carolina.\nUndergraduate Awards\nUndergraduates may be considered for the Watts and Betsy Carr Awards,\nMary and Watts Hill Jr. Awards, and Robert Alonzo Winston Scholarships.\nUndergraduate Research\nAll students are encouraged (but not required) to complete an\nindependent or team research project. Such projects introduce students\nto the tools needed for graduate study. They also provide an important\nopportunity for working directly with the world-class environmental\nfaculty members and graduate students at UNC\u2013Chapel Hill, as well as\nin the many environmental organizations in the Research Triangle. The\nTriangle area contains one of the largest collections of environmental\norganizations and expertise in the world, providing unique opportunities\nfor students to conduct research on an immense range of topics from\nfundamental scientific research to policy applications.\n\nEnvironmental Science and Studies\nMinor\nContact Information\nCurriculum for the Environment and Ecology\nhttp://www.cee.unc.edu\n3301 Venable Hall, CB# 3275\n(919) 962-1270\n\nAmy E.

This multidisciplinary\napproach provides unique academic and research opportunities for\nstudents.\n\nAdvising\n\nStudent advising is overseen by the director of undergraduate studies;\nindividual student advising is distributed among the department\u2019s faculty\nmembers. Students interested in one of the concentrations will be\nadvised and mentored by an environmental sciences and engineering\nfaculty member whose expertise is relevant to the concentration. The\nprogram director and staff in the Student Services Office will verify\nthat coursework requirements for the concentration have been met.\nUndergraduate students are encouraged to meet regularly with the\nprogram director and review their Tar Heel Tracker each semester. The\nprogram director and the Office of Student Services staff work with\ncurrent and prospective majors by appointment (see contact information\nabove). Departmental academic advising is particularly important for\nthose majors who are considering going on to the dual bachelor\u2019s\u2013\nmaster\u2019s degree. Further information on courses, undergraduate research\nopportunities, the honors program, careers, and graduate schools may be\nobtained from the department\u2019s Web site.\n\nFacilities\n\nThe Department of Environmental Sciences and Engineering houses\nresearch laboratories located in Rosenau Hall, McGavran-Greenberg\nHall, Michael Hooker Research Center, the Baity Building, and off-\ncampus research facilities. These laboratories are involved in important\nresearch in water quality, biogeochemistry, atmospheric chemistry\nand air pollution, effects of environmental chemicals on DNA tissues\nand organisms, environmental and public health microbiology, and\noccupational health and safety.\n\nThe department also offers facilities for modeling and computational\nanalysis of environmental systems, such as atmospheric circulation\nand air quality models, ground and surface water flow and transport\nmodels, fluid flow and contaminant transport models for indoor air\nenvironments, exposure analysis and health effects, risk assessment, and\nenvironmental epidemiology.\n\nUniversity of North Carolina at Chapel Hill \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  445\n\nMore detailed information about the individual laboratories and centers\ncan be found at the department Web site (http://www.sph.unc.edu/envr).\n\nGraduate School and Career Opportunities\n\nWhile undergraduate education prepares students for citizenship in ways\nthat go beyond professional concerns, the program in environmental\nhealth sciences also provides skills needed for employment and graduate\nstudy. Students ending their studies at the undergraduate level gain skills\nnecessary to work in positions such as risk analysts in consulting firms\nand regulatory agencies; research assistants in local, state, and national\nenvironmental and environmental health departments; and scientific\nadvisors to environmental organizations. The degree also prepares\nstudents for graduate study in the environmental sciences, environmental\nhealth sciences, environmental studies, toxicology, and professional\ndisciplines such as medicine, environmental law, and public health.\n\nUndergraduate students with appropriate science backgrounds have the\nopportunity to pursue a dual bachelor\u2019s\u2013master\u2019s degree. This program\nallows students to complete a master\u2019s degree in the department\nwithin one additional year of study beyond receipt of the bachelor\u2019s\ndegree. Interested students should read the program description and\nrequirements carefully; they can be found online (http://sph.unc.edu/\nenvr/envr-degrees).\n\nStudents have opportunities to explore possibilities for employment\nthrough the rich network of connections among the department,\nUniversity, and numerous environmental organizations in the Research\nTriangle Park area, which is home to the highest concentration of\nenvironmental health sciences groups in the nation.\n\nMajor\n\n\u2022 Environmental Health Sciences Major, B.S.P.H.

PADUA, Chair\n\nIntroduction\n\nExercise and sport science examines the physics, physiology, and\npsychology of sport and exercise; the recognition and treatment of\nathletic injuries; and the administration of athletics. The general major\nprovides foundational courses in exercise science. The athletic training\nprogram within the Department of Exercise and Sport Science can\nprepare students to work as a certified athletic trainer for high school,\ncollege, or professional sports teams. Students interested in sport\nadministration can build a foundation in the management of sport.\nSport administration career options include almost anything related to\namateur, interscholastic, or professional sports. The fitness professional\nprogram is designed to prepare students for careers in a variety of health-\nrelated fields, including but not limited to entry-level positions in the\nhealth-fitness industry; personal training of amateur, professional, and\nrecreational athletes; exercise therapy for a range of clinical conditions;\nor graduate study in exercise physiology. Other career options for majors\ninclude strength-conditioning coach for an athletic team; exercise\nresearch within the athletic, medical, or pharmaceutical industries; or\nfitness club entrepreneur. By choosing additional courses, students can\napply to schools of physical therapy, occupational therapy, public health,\nnursing, or medicine.\n\nThe overall mission of the Department of Exercise and Sport Science is to\ndiscover and promote knowledge of human movement to improve quality\nof life.\n\nAdvising\n\nAll majors and minors have a primary academic advisor in Steele\nBuilding. Students are strongly encouraged to meet regularly with\ntheir advisor and review their Tar Heel Tracker each semester. In the\nDepartment of Exercise and Sport Science five faculty members serve\nas advisors with weekly office hours (see \"Programs\" above and contact\ninformation on the Web site). The department communicates via a\nlistserv, Facebook posts, tweets, blog posts, classroom \u201cadvising\u201d\nvisits, bulletin boards/video boards throughout the building, and the\ndepartmental Web site (http://exss.unc.edu). Departmental academic\nadvising is particularly important for those majors who are considering\ngraduate school. Further information on courses, undergraduate research\nopportunities, the honors program, careers, and graduate schools may be\nobtained from the department\u2019s Web site (http://exss.unc.edu).\n\nFacilities\n\nIn addition to classroom space and physical activity area, Fetzer Hall\nhouses several well-equipped research and teaching laboratories:\n\n1. The Applied Physiology Laboratory is fully equipped to measure\n\nmetabolism, body composition, and aerobic fitness. Additionally, it\nhouses a chemistry laboratory to study the biochemistry of exercise.\n\n2. The Cadaver Anatomy Laboratory is designed to teach cadaver\n\ndissection in order to gain a greater knowledge about how the human\nbody works in an athletic environment.\n\n3. The Exercise Science Teaching Laboratory was specifically designed\n\nfor teaching exercise science laboratory experiences as well as\nclinical exercise testing experiences.\n\n4. The Sports Medicine Research Laboratory, equipped with the latest\n\nequipment to investigate athletic injuries related to the biomechanics\nand kinesiology of movement, offers as its primary research focus the\nprevention and treatment of athletic-related injuries.\n\n5. The Neuromuscular Control Laboratory is designed for the\ninvestigation of neuromuscular and biomechanical factors\nassociated with musculoskeletal/orthopedic injury and disease,\nincluding joint stability, muscle mechanics, neuromuscular control,\nmotion analysis, and postural stability.\n\n6. The CPR laboratory is a teaching laboratory for CPR and first aid\n\nskills. The laboratory is equipped with mannequins, AED trainers, and\nfirst aid equipment.\n\n7. The Exercise Oncology Laboratory is equipped with the latest\n\ntechnology for the assessment of cardiorespiratory and pulmonary\nfunction, body composition, cognitive function, electrocardiogram\nmonitoring capability, and evaluation of heart rate coherence and\nheart rate variability in oncology patients.\n\n8. Through its clinical and research initiatives, the Matthew Gfeller\n\nSport-Related Traumatic Brain Injury Research Center demonstrates\nits commitment to providing the highest level of care for athletes of\nall ages suffering from sport-related brain injuries, and to assisting\nparents, coaches, and medical professionals in managing these\nathletes.\n\n9. The Athletic Training Teaching Laboratory is designed for students to\npractice evaluation, treatment, and rehabilitation skills. It is equipped\nwith treatment tables, evaluation tools, rehabilitation supplies such\nas foam rollers, exercises balls, and taping supplies.\n\nGraduate School and Career Opportunities\n\nMany undergraduate exercise and sport science majors are preparing\nfor graduate work in related areas: exercise physiology, physical therapy,\nsports medicine, nutrition, athletic training, sports administration/\nmanagement, etc. They will be well-prepared for master\u2019s and doctoral\nprograms at major universities. Numerous opportunities exist for\ngraduate assistantships in these areas at UNC\u2013Chapel Hill and other\nlarge universities. Numerous career opportunities exist in a variety of\nfields directly related to sport and exercise. Some graduates go directly\ninto health/fitness/sport-related employment.

EMCH, Chair\n\nIntroduction\n\nGeography is the science of space, place, and environment. The\ndepartment offers classes spanning the social and natural sciences and\noffering students training in qualitative, quantitative, spatial analysis\nand modelling, and laboratory methodologies. Human geographers\nstudy the spatial aspects of human activity and physical geographers\nstudy patterns of climate, land forms, soils and water. Geographic tools\nand techniques\u2014including Geographic Information Systems, remote\nsensing, and online and interactive mapping technologies\u2014are among\nthe most important for exploring and understanding our complex world.\nGeographic inquiry is global and local, inherently interdisciplinary, and\noffers skills that enable insights into pressing issues valued by employers\nand policy makers. For example, how does climate change impact the\nway we build cities? How does globalization influence where your jeans\nare made? How can health disparities between people be overcome\nthrough policy change? By synthesizing this knowledge, geographers\ncreate unique understandings of our complex world.\n\nCareer opportunities for geographers are wide ranging in the public,\nprivate, and nongovernmental sectors. Geographers work in the areas\nof social, health, and environmental policy; energy, transportation,\neconomic, development, and tourism planning; urban and regional\nplanning; research and education; community development; resource\nmanagement; and environmental regulation and modeling.\n\nWith geography you can explore the world and find yourself.\n\nAdvising\n\nAll majors and minors have a primary academic advisor in Steele\nBuilding. Students are strongly encouraged to meet regularly with their\nadvisor and review Tar Heel Tracker each semester. The department\u2019s\ndirector of undergraduate studies works with current and prospective\nmajors by appointment and during regular office hours (see department\nWeb site as hours will vary by semester). Departmental academic\nadvising is highly recommended for all majors, in particular those\nconsidering graduate school. Further information on courses,\nundergraduate research opportunities, the honors program, careers, and\ngraduate schools may be obtained from the department\u2019s Web site.\n\nFacilities\n\nThe department has a range of specialized, state-of-the-art equipment for\ngeospatial field sampling and laboratory analysis of data in hydrology,\nclimatology, and vegetation science, including an ecohydrology\nlaboratory and a dendrology laboratory. The department is wired\ninternally to support the latest network technology. This network links\n\nus to the centrally managed servers that provide access to a large\nlibrary of software for geographic applications and research, as well as\nfirst-class library resources, data storage and backup, and access to\nsupercomputing clusters.\n\nGraduate School and Career Opportunities\n\nThere are a variety of job opportunities for geographers in government,\nbusiness, industry, and the nonprofit sector. Geographers are hired\nfor the following kinds of expertise: locational analysis, GISci, remote\nsensing, cartography, land use planning, recreation and tourism planning,\nand foreign area expertise. Many geographers pursue teaching at all\nlevels.\n\nStudents with a B.A. major in geography from UNC\u2013Chapel Hill are\nwell trained for graduate programs in geography and other disciplines.\nMajors have entered graduate programs as diverse as city and regional\nplanning, business, medicine, and ecology.

Geologists investigate diverse\nsystems that play a large role in controlling the environment at the earth\u2019s\nsurface. Examples include earthquakes, volcanoes, glaciers, landslides,\nrivers, and shorelines. Earth processes play a critical role in making\nour planet habitable, and geologists are constantly in demand to guide\ncommunities and nations in their search for resources such as clean\ndrinking water and extractable energy and minerals, or in decisions\nregarding development in fragile coastal regions or in seismically active\nareas. The Department of Geological Sciences provides students with\na solid training in earth science so that they can advance in highly\nsatisfying careers as professional geologists.\n\nMost students planning to do graduate work or to become professional\ngeologists should follow the B.S. program. However, the flexibility of\nthe B.A. program may be advantageous to students with interest in, for\nexample, environmental studies, education, or law.\n\nAdvising\n\nAll majors and minors have a primary academic advisor in Steele\nBuilding. Students are strongly encouraged to meet regularly with\ntheir advisor and review their Tar Heel Tracker each semester. The\ndepartment\u2019s director of undergraduate studies works with current and\nprospective majors by appointment. Departmental academic advising is\nparticularly important for those majors who are considering going on to\ngraduate school. Further information on courses, undergraduate research\nopportunities, the honors program, careers, and graduate schools may be\nobtained from the department\u2019s Web site.\n\nFacilities\n\nThe Department of Geological Sciences houses several laboratory\nfacilities that are available for undergraduate students to use for\nresearch. Many students are introduced to the laboratory facilities\nthrough coursework. Laboratories include\n\n1. a thermal ionization mass spectrometer for isotope and\n\ngeochronology research;\n\n2. a scanning electron microscope laboratory for image analysis,\n\nelement mapping, and semi-quantitative chemical analysis;\n3. an X-ray fluorescence spectrometer for chemical analysis of\n\ngeological materials;\n\n4. an X-ray diffractometer for rapid mineral identification;\n\n5. a direct current plasma spectrometer for analysis of major and minor\n\nelements in sample solutions;\n\n6. equipment for geophysical research and imaging, including portable\nbroadband seismic stations, infrasonic microphones, a gravimeter,\nand equipment for ship-borne reflection seismology;\n\n7. a sediment analysis laboratory including a coulometer, settling tube,\n\nand laser particle size counter;\n\n8. chemical and counting laboratories for quantifying natural and\n\nartificial radioactivity at environmental levels;\n\n9. a paleoclimate/paleoecology laboratory equipped for high-resolution\n\nmicrosampling of carbonate samples for geochemical analysis.\n\nGraduate School and Career Opportunities\n\nGeologists commonly are employed by private industry, public and\nprivate schools, colleges and universities, and consulting firms (e.g.,\nhydrology, environmental geology, engineering geology, petroleum\ngeology, and mineral exploration). Geology graduates also can find\njobs with federal or state geological surveys or with other federal/state\nenvironmental or energy firms. Some federal/state agencies prefer\ngeologists with at least a master\u2019s degree. A doctoral degree usually is\nrequired for employment at colleges and universities.\n\nMajors\n\n\u2022 Geological Sciences Major, B.A.\u2013Earth Systems Concentration\n\n(p.\u00a0496)\n\n\u2022 Geological Sciences Major, B.S.\u2013Earth Science Concentration\n\n(p.\u00a0498)\n\n\u2022 Geological Sciences Major, B.S.\u2013Environmental Geology\n\nConcentration (p.\u00a0500)\n\n\u2022 Geological Sciences Major, B.S.\u2013Geochemistry Concentration\n\n(p.\u00a0502)\n\n\u2022 Geological Sciences Major, B.S.\u2013Geophysics Concentration\n\n(p.\u00a0505)\n\n\u2022 Geological Sciences Major, B.S.\u2013Paleobiology Concentration\n\n(p.\u00a0507)\n\nMinor\n\n\u2022 Geological Sciences Minor (p.\u00a0509)\n\nGraduate Programs\n\n\u2022 M.S. in Geological Sciences (http://catalog.unc.edu/graduate/\n\nschools-departments/geological-sciences)\n\n\u2022 Ph.D. in Geological Sciences (http://catalog.unc.edu/graduate/\n\nschools-departments/geological-sciences)\n\nProfessors\n\nLarry K.

To participate in this\nprogram, the student chooses a research topic in consultation with his\nor her chosen faculty sponsor and conducts the research during the last\ntwo semesters in residence. The research project should represent the\nequivalent time expenditure of six hours of course credit and is taken as\nGEOL\u00a0691H (fall semester) and GEOL\u00a0692H (spring semester).\n\nUpon recommendation of the faculty, students may be awarded the\ndegree with honors or highest honors. Highest honors is reserved for\nstudents who have distinguished themselves in both coursework and\nindependent research. In order to obtain this distinction the student must\nmaintain a grade point average of 3.60 or higher and complete a research\nproject that is worthy of peer-reviewed publication.\nDepartmental Involvement\nThe Department of Geological Sciences encourages the active\nparticipation of undergraduates in department research, teaching, and\nsocial life. In addition to opportunities for experiential education and\nteaching internships described below, the department has an active\nGeology Honor Fraternity and Geology Club and regularly sponsors field\nexcursions, career information sessions, and social events. Dates, times,\nand locations for all events are posted on the Web site and in the main\nlobby on the first floor of Mitchell Hall.\nExperiential Education\nMany geology courses emphasize experiential learning through field\nand laboratory work. Most degree tracks include a field geology course\n(GEOL\u00a0601 and GEOL\u00a0602 or a similar course in another department) that\nfulfills the experiential education General Education requirement for the\nCollege of Arts and Sciences.

To participate in this\nprogram, the student chooses a research topic in consultation with his\nor her chosen faculty sponsor and conducts the research during the last\ntwo semesters in residence. The research project should represent the\nequivalent time expenditure of six hours of course credit and is taken as\nGEOL\u00a0691H (fall semester) and GEOL\u00a0692H (spring semester).\n\nUpon recommendation of the faculty, students may be awarded the\ndegree with honors or highest honors. Highest honors is reserved for\nstudents who have distinguished themselves in both coursework and\nindependent research. In order to obtain this distinction the student must\nmaintain a grade point average of 3.60 or higher and complete a research\nproject that is worthy of peer-reviewed publication.\nDepartmental Involvement\nThe Department of Geological Sciences encourages the active\nparticipation of undergraduates in department research, teaching, and\nsocial life.

Students should meet regularly with their primary advisor and\nreview their Tar Heel Tracker each semester.\n\nHowever, departmental academic advising is also important for\nall students majoring or minoring in the department. Current and\nprospective majors and minors should confer with the department\u2019s\ndirector of undergraduate studies (for German literature and\nculture, German media, arts, and culture), or the department\u2019s Slavic\nundergraduate advisor (for Russian language and culture and Slavic\nlanguages and cultures), or the department\u2019s Central European advisor\n(for the Central European studies concentration). The director of\nundergraduate studies, the Slavic undergraduate advisor, or the\nCentral European undergraduate advisor may all approve study abroad,\ninternship, and transfer credit, and/or serve as an honors advisor, as\nappropriate for the concentrations they work with.\n\nStudents seeking certification to teach German or Russian in public\nschools should consult advisors in the School of Education.\n\nGraduate School and Career Opportunities\n\nIn an age of rapid internationalization and globalization, proficiency in\na foreign language is no longer just an auxiliary skill but a necessary\none. Courses offered in the department make up an important part of\na liberal education, and a major can provide excellent preparation for\nmany careers, particularly when the major is combined with courses in\nbusiness, economics, political science, journalism, and various other\n\nUniversity of North Carolina at Chapel Hill \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  511\n\nfields. Recent graduates have entered careers in international business,\njournalism, publishing, and the travel industry.\n\nA bachelor of arts with a major in Germanic and Slavic languages\nand literatures also qualifies graduates for positions in the United\nStates State Department and other government agencies, educational\norganizations, foundations, and travel organizations. The presence\nof over 100 German and Swiss firms in the Carolinas testifies to the\ndemand for a high degree of German linguistic and cultural literacy\nin college graduates. The department is also one among very few in\nthe United States that offers a range of critical and/or less commonly\ntaught languages of Eastern Europe and the former USSR. People who\nknow these languages are in particularly high demand in business and\ngovernment. A graduate who has successfully taken the internationally-\nrecognized business German examination \u201cWirtschaftsdeutsch als\nFremdsprache\u201d at UNC\u2013Chapel Hill has an edge in seeking such\npositions.\n\nIn addition, the demand for language teachers provides career\nopportunities for those German and Russian majors who receive teaching\ncertification from the School of Education.\n\nGerman and Slavic majors often go on to graduate programs in\ncomparative literature, linguistics, history, law, international business and\nmanagement, international relations, professional translation, medicine,\nand education. Some pursue careers as college professors. Many\nChapel Hill German and Slavic majors have been welcomed by the most\nprestigious graduate programs in the country.

The department also presents full-length plays and dramatic\nreadings in German performed by undergraduate students.\nStudy Abroad\nThe department encourages students to study and/or engage in\ninternships abroad. These opportunities maximize students\u2019 linguistic\nand cultural proficiency, particularly once they have acquired sufficient\nlanguage skills to benefit most from this immersion experience. Students\nmay participate for a whole year, a single term, or a summer.\n\nThe Study Abroad Office offers German programs at all universities\nin the German state of Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg, as well as a dedicated\nexchange program with the Eberhard-Karls-Universit\u00e4t T\u00fcbingen; at the\nVienna (Austria) University of Economics and Business Administration;\nat the Science Exchanges in Berlin or Jena (Germany) and Vienna; at\nthe IES European Union Program in Freiburg (Germany); and at the\nIES Music Studies Program in Vienna. Most German programs require\nthat participating students have passed GERM\u00a0204 (or its equivalent);\nhowever, students with no prior knowledge of German may attend the\nFUBiS or FU-BEST programs in Berlin or the IES program in Freiburg.\nThese programs generally include intensive language instruction in\naddition to content courses taught in English, and most programs offer\nan orientation course prior to the start of the semester. The yearlong term\ntypically begins in late August and ends in late July, with a two-month\nvacation between semesters that many students use for travel. Students\ngoing abroad for only one term generally do so in the spring semester,\nwhich typically begins in late February and ends in late July.\n\nThe DAAD in conjunction with German universities usually offers some\nsummer internships.

Majors and minors should\nconsult with the director of undergraduate studies or the appropriate\nundergraduate advisor in advance of going abroad about courses they\nplan to take for the major or minor.\n\nLanguages across the Curriculum\nThe Languages across the Curriculum (LAC) Program encourages\nmajors and minors to enroll in one-credit-hour recitation or discussion\nsections that are conducted in German but associated with a variety\nof courses offered in English by other academic departments. German\nlanguage recitation sections may also be scheduled in conjunction with\nseveral of the department\u2019s courses offered in English. Each of these\ndiscussion and recitation sections counts as one German language credit\n(in addition to the credit granted for the course).\nUndergraduate Awards\nMembership in the Beta Rho chapter of Delta Phi Alpha, the German\nhonors society, is available to majors and minors who have completed\nat least six credit hours of German language coursework at the 300 level\nand who have maintained high cumulative grade point averages and high\ngrade point averages in the major.\n\nThe department selects annually one outstanding graduating senior\nmajoring in German to receive the Undergraduate Ria Stambaugh Award\nfor Excellence in German, a monetary award that is presented at the\nChancellor\u2019s Awards Ceremony each spring. Ria Stambaugh was a\npopular professor of German; after her death in 1984 her sister, friends,\nand colleagues contributed to a memorial fund to establish the Ria\nStambaugh Awards. The undergraduate award was first presented in\n1987.\n\nEstablished in 1999, the Paul Debreczeny Prize is awarded each spring to\na graduating senior whose work in Slavic languages and literatures has\nbeen judged outstanding.

Undertaking an honors project gives\nstudents the opportunity to explore a topic in depth under the direction\nof a faculty member. Seniors who wish to do honors work should confer\nwith the director of undergraduate studies and choose an honors thesis\nadvisor during the second semester of their junior year, and enroll during\ntheir senior year in GSLL\u00a0691H (honors reading and special studies)\nfollowed by GSLL\u00a0692H (writing the honors thesis). When GSLL\u00a0693H is\noffered, the course replaces GSLL\u00a0692H and provides an opportunity for\nstudents majoring in any of our concentrations to complete their thesis in\nthe context of a small seminar with other honors students. One of these\nhonors courses may count toward the major.\nStudent Involvement and Cultural Enrichment beyond\nthe Classroom\nNumerous social and educational events hosted by the department,\nas well as by student clubs such as the German Club, provide an\natmosphere for effective learning and for enjoying German and Slavic\nculture.

The department periodically sponsors lectures,\nroundtables, small conferences, and film series for the various languages.\nThose considering an undergraduate major or minor should request to be\nadded to the appropriate e-mail listserv for information regarding special\nevents and opportunities.\n\nThe department also hosts receptions and informational meetings for\nstudents interested in pursuing a major or minor or seeking opportunities\nfor internships, study abroad, graduate study, and employment in\nGermany, Russia, and Eastern or Central Europe. Every spring the\ndepartment presents a Slavic and East European talent night, or\nSpektakl\u2019, featuring skits, songs, puppet shows, plays, and poetry\nreadings in the Slavic and East European languages students are\nlearning. The department also presents full-length plays and dramatic\nreadings in German performed by undergraduate students.\nStudy Abroad\nThe department encourages students to study and/or engage in\ninternships abroad. These opportunities maximize students\u2019 linguistic\nand cultural proficiency, particularly once they have acquired sufficient\nlanguage skills to benefit most from this immersion experience. Students\nmay participate for a whole year, a single term, or a summer.\n\nThe Study Abroad Office offers German programs at all universities\nin the German state of Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg, as well as a dedicated\nexchange program with the Eberhard-Karls-Universit\u00e4t T\u00fcbingen; at the\nVienna (Austria) University of Economics and Business Administration;\nat the Science Exchanges in Berlin or Jena (Germany) and Vienna; at\nthe IES European Union Program in Freiburg (Germany); and at the\n\n\fIES Music Studies Program in Vienna. Most German programs require\nthat participating students have passed GERM\u00a0204 (or its equivalent);\nhowever, students with no prior knowledge of German may attend the\nFUBiS or FU-BEST programs in Berlin or the IES program in Freiburg.\nThese programs generally include intensive language instruction in\naddition to content courses taught in English, and most programs offer\nan orientation course prior to the start of the semester. The yearlong term\ntypically begins in late August and ends in late July, with a two-month\nvacation between semesters that many students use for travel. Students\ngoing abroad for only one term generally do so in the spring semester,\nwhich typically begins in late February and ends in late July.\n\nThe DAAD in conjunction with German universities usually offers some\nsummer internships. An internship is also available in Dresden. Please\nsee an undergraduate advisor in the department office about these\nopportunities.\n\nStudents who choose to study Dutch may study abroad in Amsterdam\nthrough the IES, or attend SIT Netherlands\u2019 Program \u201cInternational\nPerspective on Sexuality and Gender.\u201d Exchange programs also are\noffered in Nijmegen and Groningen.\n\nStudents can study in semester or yearlong programs in Russia, including\nin Moscow, St. Petersburg, and Vladimir, while earning credit towards\ntheir Carolina degree.

Majors and minors should\nconsult with the director of undergraduate studies or the appropriate\nundergraduate advisor in advance of going abroad about courses they\nplan to take for the major or minor.\nLanguages across the Curriculum\nThe Languages across the Curriculum (LAC) Program encourages\nmajors and minors to enroll in one-credit-hour recitation or discussion\nsections that are conducted in German but associated with a variety\nof courses offered in English by other academic departments. German\nlanguage recitation sections may also be scheduled in conjunction with\nseveral of the department\u2019s courses offered in English. Each of these\ndiscussion and recitation sections counts as one German language credit\n(in addition to the credit granted for the course).\nUndergraduate Awards\nMembership in the Beta Rho chapter of Delta Phi Alpha, the German\nhonors society, is available to majors and minors who have completed\nat least six credit hours of German language coursework at the 300 level\nand who have maintained high cumulative grade point averages and high\ngrade point averages in the major.\n\nThe department selects annually one outstanding graduating senior\nmajoring in German to receive the Undergraduate Ria Stambaugh Award\nfor Excellence in German, a monetary award that is presented at the\nChancellor\u2019s Awards Ceremony each spring.

Undertaking an honors project gives\nstudents the opportunity to explore a topic in depth under the direction\nof a faculty member. Seniors who wish to do honors work should confer\nwith the director of undergraduate studies and choose an honors thesis\nadvisor during the second semester of their junior year, and enroll during\ntheir senior year in GSLL\u00a0691H (honors reading and special studies)\nfollowed by GSLL\u00a0692H (writing the honors thesis). When GSLL\u00a0693H is\noffered, the course replaces GSLL\u00a0692H and provides an opportunity for\nstudents majoring in any of our concentrations to complete their thesis in\nthe context of a small seminar with other honors students. One of these\nhonors courses may count toward the major.\nStudent Involvement and Cultural Enrichment beyond\nthe Classroom\nNumerous social and educational events hosted by the department,\nas well as by student clubs such as the German Club, provide an\natmosphere for effective learning and for enjoying German and Slavic\nculture. There are weekly opportunities in German, Russian, and other\nlanguages for informal conversation suitable for both beginning and\nadvanced students. The department periodically sponsors lectures,\nroundtables, small conferences, and film series for the various languages.\nThose considering an undergraduate major or minor should request to be\nadded to the appropriate e-mail listserv for information regarding special\nevents and opportunities.\n\nThe department also hosts receptions and informational meetings for\nstudents interested in pursuing a major or minor or seeking opportunities\nfor internships, study abroad, graduate study, and employment in\n\n\fGermany, Russia, and Eastern or Central Europe. Every spring the\ndepartment presents a Slavic and East European talent night, or\nSpektakl\u2019, featuring skits, songs, puppet shows, plays, and poetry\nreadings in the Slavic and East European languages students are\nlearning. The department also presents full-length plays and dramatic\nreadings in German performed by undergraduate students.\nStudy Abroad\nThe department encourages students to study and/or engage in\ninternships abroad. These opportunities maximize students\u2019 linguistic\nand cultural proficiency, particularly once they have acquired sufficient\nlanguage skills to benefit most from this immersion experience. Students\nmay participate for a whole year, a single term, or a summer.\n\nThe Study Abroad Office offers German programs at all universities\nin the German state of Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg, as well as a dedicated\nexchange program with the Eberhard-Karls-Universit\u00e4t T\u00fcbingen; at the\nVienna (Austria) University of Economics and Business Administration;\nat the Science Exchanges in Berlin or Jena (Germany) and Vienna; at\nthe IES European Union Program in Freiburg (Germany); and at the\nIES Music Studies Program in Vienna. Most German programs require\nthat participating students have passed GERM\u00a0204 (or its equivalent);\nhowever, students with no prior knowledge of German may attend the\nFUBiS or FU-BEST programs in Berlin or the IES program in Freiburg.\nThese programs generally include intensive language instruction in\naddition to content courses taught in English, and most programs offer\nan orientation course prior to the start of the semester. The yearlong term\ntypically begins in late August and ends in late July, with a two-month\nvacation between semesters that many students use for travel. Students\ngoing abroad for only one term generally do so in the spring semester,\nwhich typically begins in late February and ends in late July.\n\nThe DAAD in conjunction with German universities usually offers some\nsummer internships. An internship is also available in Dresden. Please\nsee an undergraduate advisor in the department office about these\nopportunities.\n\nStudents who choose to study Dutch may study abroad in Amsterdam\nthrough the IES, or attend SIT Netherlands\u2019 Program \u201cInternational\nPerspective on Sexuality and Gender.\u201d Exchange programs also are\noffered in Nijmegen and Groningen.\n\nStudents can study in semester or yearlong programs in Russia, including\nin Moscow, St. Petersburg, and Vladimir, while earning credit towards\ntheir Carolina degree. Students also may participate in the ACTR Moscow\nsummer program in Russia. UNC\u2013Chapel Hill offers four semester-\nlong programs and one summer program in the Czech Republic. For\nmore information about these and other programs in eastern and\ncentral Europe, go to studyabroad.unc.edu. Majors and minors should\nconsult with the director of undergraduate studies or the appropriate\nundergraduate advisor in advance of going abroad about courses they\nplan to take for the major or minor.\nLanguages across the Curriculum\nThe Languages across the Curriculum (LAC) Program encourages\nmajors and minors to enroll in one-credit-hour recitation or discussion\nsections that are conducted in German but associated with a variety\nof courses offered in English by other academic departments. German\nlanguage recitation sections may also be scheduled in conjunction with\nseveral of the department\u2019s courses offered in English. Each of these\ndiscussion and recitation sections counts as one German language credit\n(in addition to the credit granted for the course).\n\nUniversity of North Carolina at Chapel Hill \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  539\n\nUndergraduate Awards\nMembership in the Beta Rho chapter of Delta Phi Alpha, the German\nhonors society, is available to majors and minors who have completed\nat least six credit hours of German language coursework at the 300 level\nand who have maintained high cumulative grade point averages and high\ngrade point averages in the major.\n\nThe department selects annually one outstanding graduating senior\nmajoring in German to receive the Undergraduate Ria Stambaugh Award\nfor Excellence in German, a monetary award that is presented at the\nChancellor\u2019s Awards Ceremony each spring. Ria Stambaugh was a\npopular professor of German; after her death in 1984 her sister, friends,\nand colleagues contributed to a memorial fund to establish the Ria\nStambaugh Awards. The undergraduate award was first presented in\n1987.\n\nEstablished in 1999, the Paul Debreczeny Prize is awarded each spring to\na graduating senior whose work in Slavic languages and literatures has\nbeen judged outstanding. This monetary prize honors one of the founding\nfaculty members of the program in Slavic languages and literatures.\nUndergraduate Research\nIn addition to honors thesis work, students are encouraged to work on\ncourse-complementary or independent research projects with department\nfaculty.

UNC\u2013Chapel Hill undergraduates\nspend from two to four semesters at the National University of Singapore\nand receive a joint bachelor of arts degree with a major in history from\nboth institutions. For further information about the Joint Degree Program,\nsee the department Web site (http://history.unc.edu/undergraduate-\nprogram/joint-degree-program-with-the-national-university-of-singapore)\nor contact the Study Abroad Office and the director of undergraduate\nstudies in the Department of History.\n\nSpecial Opportunities in History\nHonors in History\nThe departmental honors program is open to any qualified history\nmajor with at least a 3.3 cumulative grade point average and, under\nnormal circumstances, a 3.4 in history courses, and experience in\n\nUniversity of North Carolina at Chapel Hill \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  585\n\nresearch and writing derived from an undergraduate seminar in history\n(HIST\u00a0398). The student pursuing a degree in history with honors must\ntake HIST\u00a0691H and HIST\u00a0692H; these two courses contribute credit\nhours toward fulfilling field-of-concentration requirements, depending\non the topic of the thesis. The student, in consultation with the honors\ndirector, will choose a topic and locate an appropriate faculty member\nto supervise a senior honors thesis. In HIST\u00a0691H the mechanics of\nresearching and writing a senior essay will be discussed and a start made\non the essay itself. In HIST\u00a0692H the essay will be completed and the\nstudent examined by the supervisor and at least one additional faculty\nmember to be agreed upon by the student and supervisor. To receive\nhighest honors the essay must be recommended by the examiners and\na review committee. The director of honors, in consultation with the\nexaminers and review committee, will recommend that the student who\nhas defended the essay graduate with either honors or highest honors,\nor merely with course credit. Students should submit applications for\nthe honors program by the end of February during their junior year. For\ndetailed guidelines click here (http://history.unc.edu/undergraduate-\nprogram/senior-honors-thesis) or contact the director of honors in the\nDepartment of History.\nDepartmental Involvement\nStudents with broad interests in the intellectual and social life of the\ndepartment may volunteer to serve on the department\u2019s Undergraduate\nStudies Committee (UGSC).

Inquiries may be\nmade through e-mail (uthomp@email.unc.edu). Students should come\nprepared with a draft of their major proposal. Students are strongly\nencouraged to meet regularly with their advisor and review their Tar Heel\nTracker each semester.\n\nGraduate School and Career Opportunities\n\nSince IDST can provide a broad background in the liberal arts, graduate\nstudy in a number of academic disciplines is possible.

These include the Julia Crane, Halpern, and Mellon Awards.\nThe Federico Gil award recognizes the best undergraduate honors thesis\nwritten on a Latin American or Caribbean topic. Contact the director of\nundergraduate studies for information.\nUndergraduate Research\nLatin American Studies majors are eligible to develop a senior thesis\nproject in their last year. The thesis may be related to a field work project\nthe summer after the junior year.

The minor is designed\nto allow students access to departmental courses, facilities, and advisors\nin order to develop marine specializations related to their majors and\nto prepare for postgraduate study in marine sciences or a related field.\nIntroductory courses also are offered for all undergraduates who are\ninterested in marine sciences.\n\nAdvising\n\nThe director of undergraduate studies advises students on selecting\nappropriate coursework in marine sciences, reviews progress toward\ncompletion of the minor, and assists in approving equivalent courses. All\ncurrent and prospective minors are strongly encouraged to meet with the\ndirector of undergraduate studies prior to declaring their minor.\n\nFacilities\n\nResearch laboratories are equipped for general studies in marine\nsciences and the special research interests of faculty and students.\nThe Institute of Marine Sciences, located in Morehead City, NC, houses\nlaboratory buildings with dock and ocean access. The Institute operates\na modern 48-foot coastal vessel, the R.V. Capricorn, and a fleet of\noutboard-powered boats.\n\nGraduate School and Career Opportunities\n\nThe director of undergraduate studies advises students on graduate\nschool and/or career opportunities in marine sciences.\n\nMinor\n\n\u2022 Marine Sciences Minor (p.\u00a0610)\n\nGraduate Programs\n\n\u2022 M.S. in Marine Sciences (http://catalog.unc.edu/graduate/schools-\n\ndepartments/marine-sciences)\n\n\u2022 Ph.D. in Marine Sciences (http://catalog.unc.edu/graduate/schools-\n\ndepartments/marine-sciences)\n\nProfessors\n\nCarol Arnosti, John M.

Students work directly with\nfaculty members and may enroll for credit as part of an honors or\nresearch project. The liaison for undergraduate research provides\ninformation about research opportunities in marine sciences, and assists\nundergraduates in finding a faculty advisor/research group that matches\ntheir interests.\nExperiential Education\nThere are three opportunities for experiential education in the Department\nof Marine Sciences:\n\nMASC\u00a0220 is taught during Maymester at the main campus with one\nweek at the UNC\u2013Chapel Hill Institute of Marine Sciences in Morehead\nCity, NC.\n\nMASC\u00a0395 can be taken with the permission of a faculty advisor.\n\nMASC\u00a0472 is taught at the UNC\u2013Chapel Hill Institute of Marine Sciences\nin Morehead City, NC, during the summer session and provides an\nexperience in the field.\n\n\f612\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  Department of Mathematics\n\nDepartment of Mathematics\nContact Information\n\nDepartment of Mathematics\nhttp://www.math.unc.edu\nPhillips Hall, CB# 3250\n(919) 962-1294\n\nJeremy Marzuola, Director of Undergraduate Studies\nmarzuola@email.unc.edu\n\nElizabeth Davidson, Manager of Student Services\nelizabeth_davidson@unc.edu\n\nRICHARD MCLAUGHLIN, Chair\n\nIntroduction\n\nMathematics has always been a fundamental component of human\nthought and culture, and the growth of technology in recent times has\nfurther increased its importance. UNC\u2013Chapel Hill offers several degrees\nin mathematics and the mathematical sciences, providing students a\nchoice of careers in this field. Among the jobs in industry, government,\nand the academic world that involve mathematics are actuary, analyst,\nmodeler, optimizer, statistician, and computer analyst.\n\nStudents intending to teach mathematics in elementary and middle\nschool and students enrolled in the School of Education who intend to\nmajor in mathematics should consult the School of Education section of\nthe Catalog or the director of mathematical education in the Department\nof Mathematics. A section below suggests course selections for future\nhigh school teachers.\n\nAdvising\n\nAll majors and minors have a primary academic advisor in Steele\nBuilding. Students should regularly meet with their advisors and review\ntheir Tar Heel Trackers to be sure that they are satisfying distribution and\ndegree requirements. In addition, junior and senior majors are assigned\neach semester a mathematics faculty member as an advisor with whom\nthey must meet to discuss course selections and any other questions\nbefore a hold on registration is lifted. The department\u2019s director of\nundergraduate studies and assistant (see contact information above)\nare also available by appointment. Further information on courses,\nundergraduate research opportunities, the honors program, careers,\nand graduate schools may be obtained from the department\u2019s Web site\n(http://www.math.unc.edu).\n\nPlacement into Mathematics Courses\n\nStandardized test scores such as the Advanced Placement (AP),\nScholastic Achievement Test Subject Levels I or II (SAT), or the American\nCollege Test (ACT) can be used for placement into mathematics courses.\nPlease visit the placement page (http://math.unc.edu/for-undergrads/\nplacement-info) of the department\u2019s Web site for specific information\nregarding placement.\n\nGraduate School and Career Opportunities\n\nThe B.S. degree program, especially if it includes the sequences\nMATH\u00a0521\u2013MATH\u00a0522 and MATH\u00a0577\u2013MATH\u00a0578, is excellent\npreparation for graduate study in the mathematical sciences. The B.A.\ndegree can be excellent preparation for graduate study in many fields,\nincluding admission into professional schools of law, business, and\n\nmedicine. Both degrees are viewed by many employers as attractive,\nespecially when accompanied by electives in areas such as statistics,\ncomputer science, economics, and operations research. Undergraduate\nmathematics majors with critical thinking skills and good analytical\nabilities are in demand in many business, industry, and government\nfields.\n\nMajors\n\n\u2022 Mathematics Major, B.A. (p.\u00a0619)\n\u2022 Mathematics Major, B.S.

CHARLES JENNETTE, Brinkhous Distinguished Professor and Chair\n\nIntroduction\n\nPathology is the study of disease, its causes, development, and\nconsequences. It is concerned with basic mechanisms of disease\nprocesses (pathobiology) and their structural/functional manifestations.\nPathology combines the tools and the basic knowledge from many\ndisciplines, such as molecular biology, cell biology, biochemistry,\ngenetics, immunology, anatomy, and clinical sciences, to clarify the\ncause (etiology), natural course (pathogenesis), and diagnosis of\ndisease. The department offers several pathology courses appropriate for\nundergraduate study.\n\nIn addition to formal courses, faculty members in the Department of\nPathology and Laboratory Medicine of the UNC School of Medicine\nmaintain active research programs and engage in training predoctoral\nstudents and postdoctoral fellows in a range of research endeavors.\nUndergraduate students interested in participating in a hands-on\nresearch experience should contact the director of graduate studies in\npathology for more information.

Based on faculty evaluations,\nthe baccalaureate degree may be conferred with honors or with highest\nhonors, or merely with course credit.\nDepartmental Involvement\nUndergraduates can participate in the activities and programs of\nthe Triangle Institute for Security Studies at no cost by becoming a\nWickersham Scholar. To become a scholar, a student must have a faculty\nsponsor and a demonstrated interest in international security studies.\nFor more information contact Carolyn Pumphrey at (919) 613-9280 or\npumphrey@duke.edu.\nExperiential Education\nInternship courses provide students with the opportunity to earn\nacademic credit while obtaining practical work experience in agencies\nand organizations clearly related to national and international security.\nIn recent years students have served in these and other agencies: The\nCentral Intelligence Agency, Durham Police Department, Office of Naval\nIntelligence, Defense Intelligence Agency, Carolina for Kibera, Center for\nStrategic and International Studies, Peace Action, United States Army\nSpecial Operations Command, and many more. Students are limited to\none internship for credit, and all internships are limited to three hours\nof academic credit. Although some routine administrative tasks are\nrequired in any professional setting, the expectation is that a majority of\nthe intern\u2019s work will be directed toward the substantive mission of the\nagency and that tasks will be of a nature to justify awarding academic\ncredit. All internships require prior approval, and all must consist of\nat least eight hours per week and at least 100 hours per semester.\nStudents must sign an internship contract with their agency and faculty\nsupervisors, setting out expectations and course requirements. Interns\nare required to keep a daily internship journal. Once approved for an\ninternship, students enroll in PWAD\u00a0393, which is offered on a Pass/\nFail basis only and does not count toward the nine courses required\nfor the major. Students wishing credit towards the major derived from\ntheir internship work should pursue an independent study with a faculty\nsupervisor either while taking the internship or in the next semester. That\nindependent study should produce a major written product, would be\ngraded normally, and receives credit in the major.\nStudy Abroad\nThe curriculum encourages all undergraduates to study abroad either\nfor a summer, a semester, or an entire year. Students should consult the\nstudy abroad (http://studyabroad.unc.edu) Web site and visit the Study\nAbroad Office as early as possible in their course of study to meet with\na study abroad advisor. A number of foreign programs contain courses\nthat qualify for major credit. Of particular usefulness is study at the\nKing\u2019s College, University of London War Studies Department, the closest\nanalogue to the Curriculum in Peace, War, and Defense in the English-\nspeaking world and a program with a renowned faculty. Students with\nat least a 3.3 grade point average are eligible to apply to King\u2019s College.\nWhile supervision arrangements need to be negotiated and agreed with\nrelevant faculty members, students writing honors theses in their senior\nyear may also apply to spend the year at King\u2019s College.\nUndergraduate Research\nStudents who qualify are encouraged to experience original research by\nwriting a senior honors thesis described in the honors section above.\n\n\fDepartment of Philosophy\nContact Information\n\nDepartment of Philosophy\nhttp://philosophy.unc.edu\nCaldwell Hall, 240 East Cameron, CB# 3125\n(919) 962-7291\n\nProfessor Mariska Leunissen, Director of Undergraduate Studies\nmariska@email.unc.edu\n\nMARC LANGE, Chair\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe principal goal of the study of philosophy is to enable students\nto think more clearly, deeply, and appreciatively about themselves\nand their world. Study of philosophy enhances analytical, critical, and\ninterpretive capacities that are applicable to any subject matter in almost\nany context. It provides many opportunities for expressing oneself, for\nreflecting on questions that human beings have pondered for millennia,\nfor exchanging reasoned beliefs and engaging in focused debate, and for\nlearning how to come to terms with problems for which there are no easy\nanswers. A good philosophical education also helps to prepare students\nfor responsible and intelligent participation in political and community\naffairs.\n\nThe most important outcome of philosophical study is the ability to\nengage in thinking that is at once disciplined and imaginatively creative.\nWhile such thinking lies at the heart of the philosophical enterprise,\nit is also needed for success in any complex intellectual or practical\nendeavor. Philosophy\u2019s attention to critical thought, rigorous argument,\nand articulate expression makes the philosophical curriculum absolutely\ncentral to a liberal education and valuable as a basis for further training in\na variety of pursuits.\n\nExamples of philosophical questions are\n\n\u2022 How should we understand truth, existence, validity, fact, value, free\n\nwill?\n\n\u2022 What are the principles or presuppositions of science, language,\n\npolitical systems, religious and moral views?\n\n\u2022 What is the nature of a person, of space and time, of a work of art?\n\u2022 What is the wisdom of the past on these enduring questions? How\n\ncan we learn from people such as Plato, Aristotle, Descartes, and\nKant?\n\nStudents are encouraged to view philosophy not as a specialized,\nesoteric discipline, but instead as an activity integral to a liberal arts\neducation, helping students to think more cogently and appreciatively\nabout themselves and their world.\n\nPHIL\u00a0101, PHIL\u00a0110, or PHIL\u00a0112 is recommended as a first course for\nthose interested in philosophical issues and their cultural significance\nand for those who wish to examine a broad range of philosophical topics,\nproblems, or historical figures. Other good starting points are PHIL\u00a0155,\nwhich deals with logic and the analysis of argument; PHIL\u00a0160, which\ndeals with moral thought and experience; and PHIL\u00a0150, which deals with\nthe concepts, methods, and foundations of the biological and physical\nsciences.\n\nUniversity of North Carolina at Chapel Hill \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  667\n\nPHIL\u00a0155 is recommended for all students who major or minor in\nphilosophy.\n\nAdvising\n\nAll majors and minors have a primary academic advisor in Steele\nBuilding. Students are strongly encouraged to meet regularly with\ntheir advisor and review their Tar Heel Tracker each semester. The\ndepartment\u2019s director of undergraduate studies works with current\nand prospective majors by appointment (see contact information\nabove). Departmental academic advising is particularly important for\nthose majors who are considering going on to graduate school. Further\ninformation on courses, undergraduate research opportunities, the\nhonors program, careers, and graduate schools may be obtained from the\ndepartment\u2019s Web site.\n\nGraduate School and Career Opportunities\n\nA major in philosophy offers excellent preparation for many careers\nin which clear thinking and analytical ability are valued. Some majors\nchoose to pursue graduate work in philosophy in preparation for college\nor university teaching (Ph.D. normally required), but the philosophy major\nalso provides the form of rigorous and systematic intellectual training\nthat is of crucial importance in law, medicine, business, and other fields.\n\nMajor\n\n\u2022 Philosophy Major, B.A. (p.\u00a0676)\n\nMinors\n\n\u2022 Philosophy Minor (p.\u00a0677)\n\u2022 Philosophy, Politics, and Economics (PPE) Minor (p.\u00a0678)\n\nGraduate Programs\n\n\u2022 M.A. in Philosophy (http://catalog.unc.edu/graduate/schools-\n\ndepartments/philosophy)\n\n\u2022 Ph.D. in Philosophy (http://catalog.unc.edu/graduate/schools-\n\ndepartments/philosophy)\n\nDistinguished Professors\n\nSimon Blackburn, Thomas E.

These serve as\nsuitable first courses in philosophy for many students, as do some\ncourses below 299, in particular PHIL\u00a0230, PHIL\u00a0266, and PHIL\u00a0280.\nCourses numbered 101 to 120 are general survey courses. Courses\nnumbered 130 to 290 are oriented toward particular problems or topics.\nCourses numbered 210 to 229 concern the history of philosophy. Courses\nnumbered 300 to 399 are designed for advanced undergraduates and\nmajors and carry a prerequisite of one course in philosophy. (Some\nmay carry additional prerequisites.) Courses between 400 and 699 are\nfor advanced undergraduates as well as graduate students.

The study of matter and energy encompasses a range of\nphenomena, from the subnuclear to the cosmological. Physics seeks\nto understand the way the universe \u201cworks,\u201d from the very small scale\n(quarks and neutrinos) to the human scale (materials encountered in\ndaily life) to the structure of the cosmos. Different approaches and\ntechnologies are used in these different regimes.\n\nThe areas of active research at UNC\u2013Chapel Hill can be divided into\nnuclear physics and nuclear astrophysics, condensed matter and\nmaterials physics, field and particle physics, astronomy and astrophysics,\nand biophysics. Often the separation between subfields is not as distinct\nas it appears. For example, nuclear and particle physics are used to\naddress questions in astrophysics. As scientists have learned more\nabout the universe, they have realized that even the boundaries between\nthe sciences have blurred. Today, physics shares interests with biology,\nchemistry, and computer science. Physicists are also responsible for the\ninvention of much of our modern technology, including computers, lasers,\nmedical imaging devices such as MRI and ultrasound, nuclear reactors,\nand the World Wide Web.\n\nPhysics has played a significant role in shaping modern society and\nculture, and some knowledge of physics is essential to fully appreciate\nthe world. As the frontiers of physics and astronomy have advanced,\nold questions have been answered or refined, new questions have been\nasked, and major surprises have been encountered. The joy of doing\nphysics is \u201cTo see a world in a grain of sand and a heaven in a wild flower,\n\nhold infinity in the palm of your hand and eternity in an hour\u201d (William\nBlake).\n\nAdvising\n\nAll majors and minors have a primary academic advisor in Steele\nBuilding. Students are encouraged to meet regularly with their advisor\nand review their Tar Heel Tracker each semester. The department\u2019s\ndirector of undergraduate studies and faculty advisors work with current\nand prospective majors by appointment (see \u201cContact Information\u201d\nabove). Faculty advisors are assigned to all physics majors and minors,\nand they assist students in a variety of physics related areas, including\nphysics course planning, undergraduate research opportunities, the\nhonors program, internships, career opportunities, and graduate school\nand fellowship applications. Physics majors are required to meet with\ntheir departmental advisor by appointment prior to registering for any\nsemester beyond the fourth term in residence. Further information may\nbe obtained from the department\u2019s Web site under the Undergraduate\nProgram (http://physics.unc.edu/undergraduate-program).\n\nGraduate School and Career Opportunities\n\nEmployers know that physicists understand how to think and reason\neffectively about the world, which equips them to solve unconventional\nchallenging problems. Over 90 percent of physics majors do something\nother than teach and conduct research at a university. Physics will\nprepare you to pursue anything from medicine to energy to business.\nThe American Institute of Physics\u2019 Career Resources (http://aip.org/\ncareer-resources) site provides useful information about the careers\nof physics bachelor\u2019s degree recipients, including who is hiring them in\nNorth Carolina.\n\nThose who are considering going on to graduate school in physics,\nastronomy, and other physical science and engineering fields, should\ncontact one of the physics advisors. Those who are considering marine\nsciences as a graduate specialty should consult the material under\nthe Department of Marine Sciences. Those who plan careers in health\nsciences, including dentistry, medicine, and veterinary medicine, should\nconsult advisors in the Health Professions Advising Office in Hanes\nHall.

Students should register for the\ncourse in the fall or spring of their senior year. The course provides a\nbridge between policy analysis as it is studied in an academic setting and\npolicy analysis as it is practiced in the workplace. Students work in small\nteams to produce actionable, client-centered, public policy analysis for a\ngovernment agency or nonprofit organization.\nInternships\nStudents may receive academic credit for an approved internship if\nit provides an academically relevant experience in policy analysis or\nresearch. Students who wish to complete an internship with an external\norganization can do so through PLCY\u00a0293 (available to public policy\nmajors and minors). PLCY\u00a0293 is a Pass/Fail course.

The principal aims of the\ndepartment are to preserve, increase, and transmit knowledge and\nunderstanding of the Romance languages, literatures, and cultures within\nthe global and regional contexts in which they have developed.\n\nOur course offerings present a diversity of approaches\u2014historical,\nliterary, linguistic, sociopolitical, cultural, and theoretical\u2014to the study of\nliterary and nonliterary texts and cultures of Europe, the Mediterranean,\nand the Americas. Students acquire competence in the practice and\nanalysis of Romance languages together with a critical knowledge of the\nwritten,\u00a0oral,\u00a0and visual\u00a0traditions\u00a0of their origin and diaspora. Our faculty\npromotes interdisciplinary connections and incorporates the study of\nliterature,\u00a0culture,\u00a0theory, and history across the curriculum. Through\ncoursework that emphasizes rhetoric, composition, and written and oral\nexpression, our majors receive sustained personalized training in critical\nthinking and close reading.\n\nAdvising\n\nAll majors and minors can find their primary academic advisor in\nDey Hall. Students are strongly encouraged to meet regularly with\ntheir advisor and review their Tar Heel Tracker each semester. Each\nof the department\u2019s language advisors will meet with current and\nprospective majors by appointment. Departmental academic advising\nis particularly important for those majors who are considering going\non to graduate school. Further information on courses, undergraduate\nresearch opportunities, the honors program, careers, and graduate\nschools may be obtained from the department\u2019s Web site (http://\nromancestudies.unc.edu).\n\nFacilities\n\nStudents taking courses in the Department of Romance Studies have\noutstanding support for their work through the Language Resource\nCenter (LRC), housed on the ground floor of Dey Hall. The LRC provides\nresources and services for language teaching and learning, including\naudio and video materials; smart classrooms with PCs and projection\nequipment; listening, viewing, and recording facilities; and online\ndatabases for language learning.\n\nGraduate School and Career Opportunities\n\nThe master of arts in teaching (M.A.T.) degree is intended for students\nwho wish to teach at the secondary level. M.A. and Ph.D. programs in\nRomance languages are almost exclusively oriented toward literary\nstudies, and the undergraduate student should prepare accordingly. A\n\nUniversity of North Carolina at Chapel Hill \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  769\n\nreading knowledge of Latin is sometimes required, as is at least one\nother Romance language (generally Italian or Spanish). Useful allied\ndisciplines are English, history, classics, philosophy, linguistics, and art\nhistory. A double major with one of these fields is often desirable. Faculty\nmembers can advise students on choices of graduate schools. Ratings of\nprograms are published from time to time and are available through the\ndepartment.\n\nFor students seeking careers in international business and law,\njournalism, publishing, social work, and the health professions, a second\nmajor or minor in a language is an asset. This also applies to students\nwho wish to work in a field that makes knowledge of French, Italian,\nPortuguese, or Spanish desirable, such as history, art, Latin American\nstudies, or global studies.\n\nMajors\n\n\u2022 Romance Languages Major, B.A.\u2013French and Francophone Studies\n\n(p.\u00a0788)\n\n\u2022 Romance Languages Major, B.A.\u2013Italian (p.\u00a0789)\n\u2022 Romance Languages Major, B.A.\u2013Portuguese (p.\u00a0791)\n\u2022 Romance Languages Major, B.A.\u2013Hispanic Literatures and Cultures\n\n(p.\u00a0793)\n\n\u2022 Romance Languages Major, B.A.\u2013Hispanic Linguistics (p.\u00a0795)\n\nMinors\n\n\u2022 French Minor (p.\u00a0797)\n\u2022 Italian Minor (p.\u00a0797)\n\u2022 Portuguese Minor (p.\u00a0798)\n\u2022 Hispanic Studies Minor (p.\u00a0799)\n\u2022 Spanish for the Professions Minor (p.\u00a0800)\n\nGraduate Programs\n\n\u2022 M.A. in Romance Languages and Literatures (http://catalog.unc.edu/\n\ngraduate/schools-departments/romance-studies)\n\n\u2022 Ph.D. in Romance Languages and Literatures (http://\n\ncatalog.unc.edu/graduate/schools-departments/romance-studies)\n\nProfessors\n\nSamuel Amago, Lucia Binotti, Frank A.

The department\u2019s\nfaculty is particularly strong in the areas of social inequality, marriage\nand family, the life course and aging, work and the economy, religion,\nformal organizations, sex and gender, social movements, population\nand human ecology, poverty and welfare, medical sociology, social\nnetworks, education, and political sociology. Course themes range widely\nfrom the theoretical to the applied and incorporate a broad array of\nmethodological approaches including comparative/historical, participant\nobservation and interviewing, survey data collection and statistical\nanalysis.\n\nManagement and society is an interdisciplinary major that focuses\non the institutional context and inner workings of organizations. It\nprepares students for a variety of positions in private or public-sector\norganizations. Additionally, many students find the curriculum to be\nexcellent preparation for a variety of business-oriented graduate and\nprofessional degree programs.\n\nAdvising\n\nAll majors and minors have a primary academic advisor in Steele\nBuilding. Students are strongly encouraged to meet regularly with\ntheir advisor and review their Tar Heel Tracker each semester. The\ndepartment\u2019s director of undergraduate studies and assistant directors\nmeet with current, transfer, and prospective majors by appointment (see\ncontact information on the program page of the catalog). Departmental\nacademic advising is particularly important for those students who\nare double majors and those who may be considering going on to\ngraduate school. Further information on courses, undergraduate research\nopportunities, writing an honors thesis, careers, and graduate schools is\navailable on the department\u2019s Web site.\n\nGraduate School and Career Opportunities\n\nSociologists are employed by research institutes, public health and\nwelfare organizations, social work agencies, private businesses, law\nfirms, international agencies, medical centers, educational institutions,\nadvertising firms, survey and polling organizations, and the criminal\njustice system. Others work in politics and government and in community\nand social justice organizing.\n\nA major in sociology also prepares students for law, medical, or business\nschool and for graduate degree programs in social work, education,\npublic policy, religious ministry, mass communications, public health,\nnonprofit administration, and international affairs. Of course the\n\nsociology major also prepares interested undergraduates for graduate\nstudies in sociology, should they choose to continue in the field to\nbecome researchers or teachers in high schools, two- or four-year\ncolleges, or research universities. Students interested in pursuing\ngraduate studies in sociology after college may, with the instructor\u2019s\npermission, enroll in graduate-level courses at UNC\u2013Chapel Hill.\n\nA major in management and society prepares students for virtually any\naspect of a business career that does not involve highly specialized\ntraining (such as finance and accounting). Employers are interested in\nstudents who can think on their feet, communicate effectively, write well,\nand make sense of the social and economic changes occurring in their\nindustry. Management and society majors are educated in each of these\nskills.\n\nGraduates with B.A. degrees with majors in management and society\nare especially suited for entry-level positions in any aspect of human\nresource management, industry, or public sector organizations. Among\nrecent graduates who responded to a placement office survey, the\nlargest number were employed in sales; management or management\ntraining positions with at least some supervisory or personnel-related\nresponsibilities ranked second. Other graduates are working in customer\nservice, purchasing, and marketing research, and several hold positions in\nthe public sector.\n\nMajors\n\n\u2022 Sociology Major, B.A. (p.\u00a0810)\n\u2022 Management and Society Major, B.A. (p.\u00a0812)\n\nMinor\n\n\u2022 Social and Economic Justice Minor (p.\u00a0814)\n\nGraduate Programs\n\n\u2022 M.A. in Sociology (http://catalog.unc.edu/graduate/schools-\n\ndepartments/sociology)\n\n\u2022 Ph.D. in Sociology (http://catalog.unc.edu/graduate/schools-\n\ndepartments/sociology)\n\nProfessors\n\nHoward E.

It is usually\ntaken by juniors and seniors who have completed at least two or three\ncourses in sociology. Students may use independent study to\n\n\u2022 Do reading and research in an area in which no course is offered\n\u2022 Take advanced or more specialized coursework in a specific area of\n\nsociology\n\nAfter an area of study has been selected, the student contacts a faculty\nmember in the department whose interests are in or related to the topic\narea. If the faculty member agrees to direct the student\u2019s independent\nstudy, the student needs final approval by the department\u2019s director\nof undergraduate studies.

Credit\nis not provided for the internship alone; some written work involving\nsociological analysis is required to receive credit for SOCI\u00a0393. Because\nof the expectation that students doing an internship for academic credit\nwill conduct substantive sociological analysis, it is very important that\nplanning begin early. Students must secure all approvals for the contract\nbefore the first day of the internship.\nUndergraduate Howard W. Odum Award\nThe Undergraduate Howard W. Odum Award is presented yearly to\na graduating senior who has displayed excellence in undergraduate\nsociological achievement. This award was established in 1967 in honor\nof Professor Howard Odum, who founded and first chaired the UNC\u2013\nChapel Hill Department of Sociology.

The department faculty\nselects the recipient of the annual award on the basis of grade records\nand other demonstrations of academic talent and accomplishment as an\nundergraduate.\nUndergraduate Research\nStudents interested in working with faculty on their research projects\nshould contact the Office for Undergraduate Research for more\ninformation and also speak with the director of undergraduate studies.\n\nManagement and Society Major, B.A.\nContact Information\n\nDepartment of Sociology\nhttp://www.unc.edu/depts/soc\n155 Hamilton Hall, CB# 3210\n(919) 962-1007\n\nMichael Dunn, Assistant Director of Undergraduate Studies\nmikewill@live.unc.edu\n\nManagement and society is an interdisciplinary major that focuses\non the institutional context and inner workings of organizations. It\nprepares students for a variety of positions in private or public-sector\norganizations. Additionally, many students find the curriculum to be\nexcellent preparation for a variety of business-oriented graduate and\nprofessional degree programs.\n\nThe phrase \u201cmanagement and society\u201d in its broadest sense\nencompasses not only direct dealings between management and\norganized labor but also matters such as governmental policy, industrial\npsychology, industrial sociology, personnel administration, and worker\n\neducation. A broad knowledge and understanding of economics, history,\nsociology, psychology, communications, and political science are\nessential. Work in this field also requires knowledge of techniques\nsuch as statistics, administrative practices, testing and measurement,\nand guidance and counseling. Majors acquire an understanding\nof the conceptual foundations and principles of interpersonal and\ninstitutional relations and of the ways these principles can be applied in\nthe work place. General areas of study are employer-employee relations,\ndevelopment of human resources, and the institutional context of work.\n\nSome students have combined management and society with\nconcentrations in such academic disciplines as economics, sociology,\npsychology, public policy, history, and political science.\n\nDepartment Programs\n\nMajors\n\n\u2022 Sociology Major, B.A. (p.\u00a0810)\n\u2022 Management and Society Major, B.A. (p.\u00a0812)\n\nMinor\n\n\u2022 Social and Economic Justice Minor (p.\u00a0814)\n\nGraduate Programs\n\n\u2022 M.A. in Sociology (http://catalog.unc.edu/graduate/schools-\n\ndepartments/sociology)\n\n\u2022 Ph.D. in Sociology (http://catalog.unc.edu/graduate/schools-\n\ndepartments/sociology)\n\nRequirements\u00a0\n\nIn addition to the program requirements listed below, students must\n\n\u2022 attain a final cumulative GPA of at least 2.0\n\u2022 complete a minimum of 45 academic credit hours earned from UNC-\n\nChapel Hill courses\n\n\u2022 take at least half of their major course requirements (courses and\n\ncredit hours) at UNC-Chapel Hill\n\n\u2022 earn a minimum of 18 hours of C or better in the major core\n\nrequirements (some majors require 21 hours).\n\nFor more information, please consult the degree requirements section of\nthe catalog (p.\u00a092).\n\nCore Requirements\nThe major in management and society consists of 10 core courses\ngrouped into the following four areas:\nEconomics:\nECON/MNGT 310 Microeconomics: Theory and Applications (by the\n\nor\u00a0ECON\u00a0410\n\nend of the junior year)\nIntermediate Theory: Price and Distribution\nEmployer-employee relations: one course from three of the five\nclusters below:\n\n3\n\n9\n\nCluster 1:\nBUSI\u00a0405\n\nCluster 2:\nCOMM\u00a0120\n\nLeading and Managing: An Introduction to\nOrganizational Behavior\n\nIntroduction to Interpersonal and Organizational\nCommunication H\n\n\fCOMM/MNGT\n223\nCOMM\u00a0325\nPSYC\u00a0563\nCluster 3:\nMNGT/SOCI\n131\nCluster 4:\nPSYC\u00a0260\nSOCI\u00a0112\nCluster 5:\nPSYC\u00a0531\n\nSmall Group Communication\n\nIntroduction to Organizational Communication H\nSmall Groups\n\nSocial Relations in the Workplace\n\nSocial Psychology H\nSocial Interaction\n\nTests and Measurement\n\nHuman resources and labor markets:\nECON/MNGT 380 The Economics of Labor Relations\nMNGT/SOCI 427 The Labor Force\nThe social context of business:\nECON/MNGT 345 Public Policy Toward Business\nMNGT/SOCI 410 Formal Organizations and Bureaucracy\nTwo additional courses are required, one course from two of the four\nclusters below:\n\nCluster 1:\nECON/MNGT\n330\nHIST/MNGT\n364\nCluster 2:\nHIST/MNGT\n365\nCluster 3:\nMNGT/SOCI\n412\nCluster 4:\nMNGT/SOCI\n415\n\nEconomic History of the United States\n\nHistory of American Business\n\nThe Worker and American Life\n\nSocial Stratification\n\nEconomy and Society\n\nAdditional Requirements\nOne of the following:\n\nCalculus for Business and Social Sciences\nCalculus of Functions of One Variable I\nDecision Models for Business\nDecision Models for Business and Economics\nGeneral Psychology\nIntroduction to Economics H\nAmerican History since 1865\nSociological Perspectives H\n\nPSYC\u00a0101\nECON\u00a0101\nHIST\u00a0128\nSOCI\u00a0101\nOne of the following applied statistics courses outside the major:\nIntroduction to Statistics and Econometrics H\nStatistical Principles of Psychological Research H\nData Analysis\n\nMATH\u00a0152\nMATH\u00a0231\nSTOR\u00a0112\nSTOR\u00a0113\n\nECON\u00a0400\nPSYC\u00a0210\nSOCI\u00a0252\nTotal Hours\n\nH Honors version available.

If the faculty member agrees to direct the student\u2019s independent\nstudy, the student needs final approval by the department\u2019s director\nof undergraduate studies. It is the student\u2019s and faculty supervisor\u2019s\nresponsibility to determine the amount of reading and/or outside work\nto be done, the frequency with which the student\u2019s progress will be\nassessed, and the papers or examinations that will constitute the course\nrequirements. An approved learning contract is necessary, and some\nwritten work involving sociological analysis is required to receive credit\nfor SOCI\u00a0396. Students must sign up for SOCI\u00a0396 before the end of the\nfirst week of classes.\nIndependent Experiential Internship\nStudents may combine employment and study in the form of an\ninternship program for which they receive one to three academic\ncredits through SOCI\u00a0393. The student must assume responsibility for\nemployment arrangements. Students may not receive credit for paid\nemployment. The student contacts a faculty member in the department\nwhose interests are in or related to the area of the internship. If the\nfaculty member agrees to direct the internship, the student needs final\napproval by the department\u2019s director of undergraduate studies. Credit\nis not provided for the internship alone; some written work involving\nsociological analysis is required to receive credit for SOCI\u00a0393. Because\nof the expectation that students doing an internship for academic credit\nwill conduct substantive sociological analysis, it is very important that\nplanning begin early. Students must secure all approvals for the contract\nbefore the first day of the internship.\nUndergraduate Howard W. Odum Award\nThe Undergraduate Howard W. Odum Award is presented yearly to\na graduating senior who has displayed excellence in undergraduate\nsociological achievement. This award was established in 1967 in honor\nof Professor Howard Odum, who founded and first chaired the UNC\u2013\nChapel Hill Department of Sociology. Odum was a pioneer in American\nsociology and a major influence on the discipline. The department faculty\nselects the recipient of the annual award on the basis of grade records\nand other demonstrations of academic talent and accomplishment as an\nundergraduate.\nUndergraduate Research\nStudents interested in working with faculty on their research projects\nshould contact the Office for Undergraduate Research for more\ninformation and also speak with the director of undergraduate studies.\n\nSocial and Economic Justice Minor\nContact Information\n\nDepartment of Sociology\nhttp://www.unc.edu/depts/soc\n155 Hamilton Hall, CB# 3210\n(919) 962-1007\n\nSherryl Kleinman, Director of Social and Economic Justice\nkleinman@email.unc.edu\n\nAlanna Gillis, Assistant Director of Social and Economic Justice\n\nalannag@live.unc.edu\n\nThe minor in social and economic justice is designed for students who\nwant to understand how to think analytically about issues of justice\nand how perspectives on justice can be joined with the pursuit of it.\nAn overarching objective is fostering attitudes and knowledge about\nhuman rights; racial, ethnic, and gender equality; economic justice;\ndemocratic participation; sustainable development; diversity; and\npeace. It is especially appropriate for students who anticipate working\nin advocacy roles in nonprofit organizations, in local communities, or in\ngovernmental organizations.

Students in this area study the\nmathematical theories of probability and statistics and their application\nto mathematical models that contain an element of uncertainty or\nrandomness. Opportunities for employment are manifold in businesses\nand government agencies dealing with many branches of the natural and\nsocial sciences, including pharmacology, environmental sciences, and\nmany others.\nOperations Research\nIn this area, students study mathematical and statistical techniques\nrelated to decision making. This branch of the mathematical decision\nsciences is crucial in business, government, and other management\nareas where difficult problems that depend on large amounts of data are\naddressed (for example, complex airline route schedules). In addition to\ntheir major courses, students interested in this field are encouraged to\ntake courses in business and economics.\nActuarial Science\nActuaries are mathematicians who work primarily in businesses\nthat involve financial risk, including the insurance industry. Students\ninterested in this field take advanced courses in statistics, stochastic\nprocesses, and the mathematical theory of risk.\n\nAdvising\n\nAll majors and minors have a primary academic advisor in Steele\nBuilding. Students are strongly encouraged to meet regularly with their\nadvisor and review their Tar Heel Tracker each semester. After contacting\nthe mathematical decision sciences office (see \u201cContact Information\u201d\nabove), all majors and minors are also assigned an undergraduate\nadvisor in the department.
